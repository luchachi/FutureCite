The design rules for materials are clear for applications with a single objective. For most applications, however, there are often multiple, sometimes competing objectives where there is no single best material and the design rules change to finding the set of Pareto optimal materials. In this work, we leverage an active learning algorithm that directly uses the Pareto dominance relation to compute the set of Pareto optimal materials with desirable accuracy. We apply our algorithm to de novo polymer design with a prohibitively large search space. Using molecular simulations, we compute key descriptors for dispersant applications and drastically reduce the number of materials that need to be evaluated to reconstruct the Pareto front with a desired confidence. This work showcases how simulation and machine learning techniques can be coupled to discover materials within a design space that would be intractable using conventional screening approaches.
Direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) involves a set of approaches for capturing CO2 directly from the air and its subsequent long-term storage. DACCS is at an early stage of technical development and currently faces a variety of challenges, including high cost and energy requirements. Building on publicly available data, this paper provides: (i) an overview and classification of DACCS systems, (ii) a harmonization of technical and economic performance of direct air capture technologies, (iii) a comprehensive list of technical- and infrastructure-based obstacles to scaling DACCS systems, and (iv) a roadmap and list of priority initiatives for research, development, demonstration, and deployment of DACCS. Our intent is to drive progress against high-impact priority actions, with a focus on accelerating research, development, and deployment of safe, scalable, and low cost DACCS as a component of the broader carbon dioxide removal portfolio.
In recent years, the scientific community has given more and more attention to the issue of climate change and global warming, which is largely attributed to the massive quantity of carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, the demand for a carbon dioxide capture material is massive and continuously increasing. In this study, we perform first-principle calculations based on density functional theory to investigate the carbon dioxide capture ability of pristine and doped beryllonitrene. Our results show that carbon dioxide had an adsorption energy of -0.046 eV on pristine beryllonitrene, so it appears that beryllonitrene has extremely weak carbon dioxide adsorption ability. Pristine beryllonitrene could be effectively doped with Lithium atoms, and the resulting Li-doped beryllonitrene had much stronger interactions with carbon dioxide than pristine beryllonitrene. The adsorption energy for carbon dioxide on Li-doped beryllonitrene was -0.408 eV. The adsorption of carbon dioxide on Li-doped beryllonitrene greatly changed the charge density, projected density of states, and band structure of the material, demonstrating that it was strongly adsorbed. This suggests that Li-doping is a viable way to enhance the carbon dioxide capture ability of beryllonitrene and makes it a possible candidate for an effective CO$_2$ capture material. 
Hydrogen and carbon dioxide transport can both play an essential role in climate-neutral energy systems. Hydrogen networks help serve regions with high energy demand, while excess emissions are transported away in carbon dioxide networks. For the synthesis of carbonaceous fuels, it is less clear which input should be transported: hydrogen to carbon point sources or carbon to low-cost hydrogen. We explore both networks' potential synergies and competition in a cost-optimal carbon-neutral European energy system. In direct comparison, a hydrogen network is more cost-effective than a carbon network, since it serves to transport hydrogen to demand and to point source of carbon for utilization. However, in a hybrid scenario where both networks are present, the carbon network effectively complements the hydrogen network, promoting carbon capture from biomass and reducing reliance on direct air capture. Our analysis suggests integrating hydrogen and carbon dioxide networks into European energy policy for a robust, carbon-neutral or carbon-negative future energy system. 
By 2035, the need for battery-grade lithium is expected to quadruple. About half of this lithium is currently sourced from brines and must be converted from a chloride into lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) through a process called softening. Conventional softening methods using sodium or potassium salts contribute to carbon emissions during reagent mining and battery manufacturing, exacerbating global warming. This study introduces an alternative approach using carbon dioxide (CO2(g)) as the carbonating reagent in the lithium softening process, offering a carbon capture solution. We employed an active learning-driven high-throughput method to rapidly capture CO2(g) and convert it to lithium carbonate. The model was simplified by focusing on the elemental concentrations of C, Li, and N for practical measurement and tracking, avoiding the complexities of ion speciation equilibria. This approach led to an optimized lithium carbonate process that capitalizes on CO2(g) capture and improves the battery metal supply chain's carbon efficiency. 
In this article, we propose two-stage planning models for Electricity-Gas Coupled Integrated Energy System (EGC-IES), in which traditional thermal power plants (TTPPs) are considered to be retrofitted into carbon capture power plants (CCPPs), with power to gas (PtG) coupling CCPPs to gas system. The sizing and siting of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS)/PtG facilities, as well as the operation cost of TTPPs/CCPPs/gas sources/PtG, are all considered in the proposed model, including penalty on carbon emissions and revenue of CCUS. With changing policy on climate change and carbon emission regulation, the uncertainties of carbon price and carbon tax are also analysed and considered in the proposed planning model. The stochastic planning, and robust planning methods are introduced to verify mutually through economic and carbon indices. The proposed methods' effectiveness in reducing carbon emissions, increasing profit of CCUS from EGC-IES are demonstrated through various cases and discussions. 
Building on the carbon reduction targets agreed in the Paris Agreements, many nations have renewed their efforts toward achieving carbon neutrality by the year 2050. In line with this ambitious goal, nations are seeking to understand the appropriate combination of technologies which will enable the required reductions in such a way that they are appealing to investors. Around the globe, solar and wind power lead in terms of renewable energy deployment, while carbon capture and storage (CCS) is scaling up toward making a significant contribution to deep carbon cuts.   Using Japan as a case study nation, this research proposes a linear optimization modeling approach to identify the potential contributions of renewables and CCS toward maximizing carbon reduction and identifying their economic merits over time. Results identify that the combination of these three technologies could enable a carbon dioxide emission reduction of between 55 and 67 percent in the energy sector by 2050 depending on resilience levels and CCS deployment regimes. Further reductions are likely to emerge with increased carbon pricing over time. 
Anthropogenic activities have led to a substantial increase in carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas (GHG), contributing to heightened concerns of global warming. In the last decade alone CO2 emissions increased by 2.0 ppm/yr. globally. In the year 2009, United States and China contributed up to 43.4% of global CO2 emissions. CO2 capture and sequestration have been recognized as promising solutions to mitigate CO2 emissions from fossil fuel based power plants. Typical techniques for carbon capture include post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture and oxy-combustion capture, which are under active research globally. Mineral carbonation has been investigated as a suitable technique for long term storage of CO2. Sequestration is a highly energy intensive process and the additional energy is typically supplied by the power plant itself. This leads to a reduction in net amount of CO2 captured because of extra CO2 emitted. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the energy consumption during sequestration process for a typical 1GW pulverized coal and a 1GW natural gas based power plant. Furthermore, it has been established that the present day sequestration methods and procedures are not viable to achieve the goal of carbon sequestration. 
Hydrogen and carbon capture and storage are pivotal to decarbonize the European energy system in a broad range of pathway scenarios. Yet, their timely uptake in different sectors and distribution across countries are affected by supply options of renewable and fossil energy sources. Here, we analyze the decarbonization of the European energy system towards 2060, covering the power, heat, and industry sectors, and the change in use of hydrogen and carbon capture and storage in these sectors upon Europe's decoupling from Russian gas. The results indicate that the use of gas is significantly reduced in the power sector, instead being replaced by coal with carbon capture and storage, and with a further expansion of renewable generators. Coal coupled with carbon capture and storage is also used in the steel sector as an intermediary step when Russian gas is neglected, before being fully decarbonized with hydrogen. Hydrogen production mostly relies on natural gas with carbon capture and storage until natural gas is scarce and costly at which time green hydrogen production increases sharply. The disruption of Russian gas imports has significant consequences on the decarbonization pathways for Europe, with local energy sources and carbon capture and storage becoming even more important. 
This paper aims to evaluate the economic viability of the energy-water-hydrogen (EWH) nexus as a new solution for reducing carbon emissions from power systems. The urgency around climate change emphasizes the pressing need to mitigate carbon emissions, especially from the electricity sector, which accounts for a significant portion of total emissions in the US. In response, incorporating more renewable energy sources (RESs) and green hydrogen, created through water electrolysis and RES, stands out as a crucial strategy to combat climate challenges. We delve into various aspects of the EWH nexus, including carbon emissions from different power plants, capturing these emissions, and potential options for their reuse or storage. This paper involves modeling different sections of the EWH nexus and conducting an economic analysis across scenarios in power plants to determine optimal water supply methods, suitable chemical products for carbon reuse, and an appropriate carbon emission penalty to encourage emission reduction through the EWH nexus. The results indicate that reusing captured carbon emissions emerges as the most beneficial option across all power plant types. This finding underscores the potential of carbon reuse as a pivotal strategy within the EWH nexus framework for addressing carbon emissions. 
Climate change due to increasing carbon emissions by human activities has been identified as one of the most critical threat to Earth. Carbon neutralization, as a key approach to reverse climate change, has triggered the development of new regulations to enforce the economic activities toward low carbon solutions. Computing networks that enable users to process computation-intensive tasks contribute huge amount of carbon emissions due to rising energy consumption. To analyze the achievable reduction of carbon emissions by a scheduling policy, we first propose a novel virtual queueing network model that captures communication and computing procedures in networks. To adapt to highly variable and unpredictable nature of renewable energy utilized by computing networks (i.e., carbon intensity of grid varies by time and location), we propose a novel carbon-intensity based scheduling policy that dynamically schedules computation tasks over clouds via the drift-plus-penalty methodology in Lyapunov optimization. Our numerical analysis using real-world data shows that the proposed policy achieves 54% reduction on the cumulative carbon emissions for AI model training tasks compared to the queue-length based policy. 
This paper presents a carbon-energy coupling management framework for an industrial park, where the carbon flow model accompanying multi-energy flows is adopted to track and suppress carbon emissions on the user side. To deal with the quadratic constraint of gas flows, a bound tightening algorithm for constraints relaxation is adopted. The synergies among the carbon capture, energy storage, power-to-gas further consume renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions. Aiming at carbon emissions disparities and supply-demand imbalances, this paper proposes a carbon trading ladder reward and punishment mechanism and an energy trading and scheduling method based on Lyapunov optimization and matching game to maximize the long-term benefits of each industrial cluster without knowing the prior information of random variables. Case studies show that our proposed trading method can reduce overall costs and carbon emissions while relieving energy pressure, which is important for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). 
Global warming is one of the main threats to the future of humanity and extensive emissions of greenhouse gases are found to be the main cause of global temperature rise as well as climate change. During the last decades international attention has focused on this issue, as well as on searching for viable solutions to mitigate global warming. In this context, the pricing of greenhouse gas emissions turned out to be the most prominent mechanism: First, to lower the emissions, and second, to capture their external costs. By now, various carbon dioxide taxes have been adopted by several countries in Europe and around the world; moreover, the list of these countries is growing. However, there is no standardized approach and the price for carbon varies significantly from one country to another. Regionally diversified carbon prices in turn lead to carbon leakage, which will offset the climate protection goals. In this paper, a simplified European power system with flexible carbon prices regarding the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is investigated. A distribution parameter that quantifies carbon leakage is defined and varied together with the base carbon price, where the combination of both parameters describes the spatially resolved price distribution, i.e. the effective carbon pricing among the European regions. It is shown that inhomogeneous carbon prices will indeed lead to significant carbon leakage across the continent, and that coal-fired electricity generation will remain a cheap and therefore major source of power in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe - representing a potential risk for the long term decarbonization targets within the European Union. 
Reactive magnesium oxide (MgO)-based cement (RMC) can play a key role in carbon capture processes. However, knowledge on the driving forces that control the degree of carbonation and hydration and rate of reactions in this system remains limited. In this work, density functional theory-based simulations are used to investigate the physical nature of the reactions taking place during the fabrication of RMCs under ambient conditions. Parametric indicators such as adsorption energies, charge transfer, electron localization function, adsorption/dissociation energy barriers and the mechanisms of interaction of H2O and CO2 molecules with MgO and brucite (Mg(OH)2) clusters are considered. The following hydration and carbonation interactions relevant to RMCs are evaluated i) carbonation of MgO, ii) hydration of MgO, carbonation of hydrated MgO, iii) carbonation of Mg(OH)2, iv) hydration of Mg(OH)2 and v) hydration of carbonated Mg(OH)2. A comparison of the energy barriers and reaction pathways of these mechanisms shows that the carbonation of MgO is hindered by presence of H2O molecules, while the carbonation of Mg(OH)2 is hindered by the formation of initial carbonate and hydrate layers as well as presence of excessed H2O molecules. To compare these finding to bulk mineral surfaces, the interactions of the CO2 and H2O molecules with the MgO(001) and Mg(OH)2 (001) surfaces are studied. Therefore, this work presents deep insights into the physical nature of the reactions and the mechanisms involved in hydrated magnesium carbonates production that can be beneficial for its development. 
The increasing importance of carbon capture technologies for deployment in remediating CO2 emissions, and thus the necessity to improve capture materials to allow scalability and efficiency, faces the challenge of materials development, which can require substantial costs and time. Machine learning offers a promising method for reducing the time and resource burdens of materials development through efficient correlation of structure-property relationships to allow down-selection and focusing on promising candidates. Towards demonstrating this, we have developed an end-to-end "discovery cycle" to select new aqueous amines compatible with the commercially viable acid gas scrubbing carbon capture. We combine a simple, rapid laboratory assay for CO2 absorption with a machine learning based molecular fingerprinting model approach. The prediction process shows 60% accuracy against experiment for both material parameters and 80% for a single parameter on an external test set. The discovery cycle determined several promising amines that were verified experimentally, and which had not been applied to carbon capture previously. In the process we have compiled a large, single-source data set for carbon capture amines and produced an open source machine learning tool for the identification of amine molecule candidates (https://github.com/IBM/Carbon-capture-fingerprint-generation). 
Recent air pollution issues have raised significant attention to develop efficient air filters, and one of the most promising candidates is that enabled by nanofibers. We explore here selective molecular capture mechanism for volatile organic compounds in carbon nanotube networks by performing atomistic simulations. The results are discussed with respect to the two key parameters that define the performance of nanofiltration, i.e. the capture efficiency and flow resistance, which validate the advantage of carbon nanotube networks with high surface-to-volume ratio and atomistically smooth surfaces. We also reveal the important roles of interfacial adhesion and diffusion that govern selective gas transport through the network. 
The B-doped monatomic carbon chain has fine molecular capture ability to H2O and especially to NO2, better than other doped monatomic carbon chains.At 300 K and 1 atm, the capture probability of the B-doped monatomic carbon chain is appreciable even in a NO2 concentration of 1 p.p.m., and the adsorbates' influence on the quantum transport is notable for the detection. In contrast, the pure monatomic carbon chain shows its invulnerability to N2, O2, H2O, NO2, CO and CO2, and it is incapable for molecule capturing due to too low adsorption ability and weak response on the quantum conductance. In the investigation of these issues, a statistic mechanical model [EPL 94, 40002 (2011); Chin. Phys. Lett. 29, 2012 (080501)] was extended to predict the adsorption and desorption rates of molecules on nanodevices. The theoretical foundation of this model was further discussed and its accuracy was verified by molecular dynamics simulations. 
The increasing electric vehicle (EV) adoption challenges the energy management of charging stations (CSs) due to the large number of EVs and the underlying uncertainties. Moreover, the carbon footprint of CSs is growing significantly due to the rising charging power demand. This makes it important for CSs to properly manage their energy usage and ensure their carbon footprint stay within their carbon emission quotas. This paper proposes a two-stage online algorithm for this purpose, considering the different time scales of energy management and carbon trading. In the first stage, the CS characterizes the real-time aggregate EV power flexibility, in terms of upper and lower bounds on the total charging power, by a Lyapunov optimization-based online algorithm. In the second stage, the CS co-optimizes energy management and carbon trading, with EV charging power chosen within the aggregate flexibility region provided by the first stage. A generalized battery model is proposed to capture the dynamic carbon footprint changes and carbon trading. A virtual carbon queue is designed to develop an online algorithm for the second stage, which can ensure the carbon footprint of CS be within its carbon emission quota and its total operation cost is nearly offline optimal. Case studies validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm. 
The technical and economic feasibility to deliver sustainable liquid biocrude through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) while enabling negative carbon dioxide emissions is evaluated in this paper, looking into the potential of the process in the context of negative emission technologies (NETs) for climate change mitigation. In the HTL process, a gas phase consisting mainly of carbon dioxide is obtained as a side product driving a potential for the implementation of carbon capture and storage in the process (BECCS) that has not been explored yet in the existing literature and is undertaken in this study. To this end, the process is divided in a standard HTL base and a carbon capture add-on, having forestry residues as feedstock. The Selexol technology is adapted in a novel scheme to simultaneously separate the CO2 from the HTL gas and recover the excess hydrogen for biocrude upgrading. The cost evaluation indicates that the additional cost of the carbon capture can be compensated by revenues from the excess process heat and the European carbon allowance market. The impact in the MFSP of the HTL base case ranges from -7% to 3%, with -15% in the most favorable scenario, with a GHG emissions reduction potential of 102-113% compared to the fossil baseline. These results show that the implementation of CCS in the HTL process is a promising alternative from technical, economic and environmental perspective in future scenarios in which advanced liquid biofuels and NETs are expected to play a role in the decarbonization of the energy system. 
The process of CO2 valorization, all the way from capture of CO2 to its electrochemical upgrade, requires significant inputs in each of the capture, upgrade, and separation steps. The gas phase CO2 feed following the capture-and-release stage and into the CO2 electroreduction stage produce a large waste of CO2, between 80 and 95% of CO2 is wasted due to carbonate formation or electrolyte crossover, that adds cost and energy consumption to the CO2 management aspect of the system. Here we report an electrolyzer that instead directly upgrades carbonate electrolyte from CO2 capture solution to syngas, achieving 100% carbon utilization across the system. A bipolar membrane is used to produce proton in situ, under applied potential, which facilitates CO2 releasing at the membrane:catalyst interface from the carbonate solution. Using an Ag catalyst, we generate pure syngas at a 3 to 1 H2 to CO ratio, with no CO2 dilution at the gas outlet, at a current density of 150 mA cm-2, and achieve a full cell energy efficiency of 35%. The direct carbonate cell was stable under a continuous 145 h of catalytic operation at ca. 180 mA cm-2. The work demonstrates that coupling CO2 electrolysis directly with a CO2 capture system can accelerate the path towards viable CO2 conversion technologies. 
A linear regression-based machine learned interatomic potential (MLIP) was developed for the silicon-carbon system. The MLIP was predominantly trained on structures discovered through a genetic algorithm, encompassing the entire silicon-carbon composition space, and uses as its foundation the Ultra-Fast Force Fields (UF3) formulation. To improve MLIP performance, the learning algorithm was modified to include higher spline interpolation resolution in regions with large potential energy surface curvature. The developed MLIP demonstrates exceptional predictive performance, accurately estimating energies and forces for structures across the silicon-carbon composition and configuration space. The MLIP predicts mechanical properties of SiC with high precision and captures fundamental volume-pressure and volume-temperature relationships. Uniquely, this silicon-carbon MLIP is adept at modeling complex high-temperature phenomena, including the peritectic decomposition of SiC and carbon dimer formation during SiC surface reconstruction, which cannot be captured with prior classical interatomic potentials for this material. 
Achieving carbon neutrality is probably one of the most important challenges of the 21st century for our societies. Part of the solution to this challenge is to leverage renewable energies. However, these energy sources are often located far away from places that need the energy, and their availability is intermittent, which makes them challenging to work with. In this paper, we build upon the concept of Remote Renewable Energy Hubs (RREHs), which are hubs located at remote places with abundant renewable energy sources whose purpose is to produce carbon-neutral synthetic fuels. More precisely, we model and study the Energy Supply Chain (ESC) that would be required to provide a constant source of carbon-neutral synthetic methane, also called e-NG (electric Natural Gas) or e-methane (electric methane), in Belgium from an RREH located in Morocco. To be carbon neutral, a synthetic fuel has to be produced from existing carbon dioxide (CO2) that needs to be captured using either Direct Air Capture (DAC) or Post Combustion Carbon Capture (PCCC). In this work, we detail the impact of three different carbon sourcing configurations on the price of the e-methane delivered in Belgium. Our results show that sourcing CO2 through a combination of DAC and PCCC is more cost-effective, resulting in a cost of 146 e/MWh for e-methane delivered in Belgium, as opposed to relying solely on DAC, which leads to a cost of 158 e/MWh. Moreover, these scenarios are compared to a scenario where CO2 is captured in Morocco from a CO2 emitting asset that allows to deliver e-methane for a cost of 136 e/MWh. 
Many natural systems exhibit tipping points where changing environmental conditions spark a sudden shift to a new and sometimes quite different state. Global climate change is often associated with the stability of marine carbon stocks. We consider a stochastic carbonate system of the upper ocean to capture such transition phenomena. Based on the Onsager-Machlup action functional theory, we calculate the most probable transition pathway between the metastable and oscillatory states via a neural shooting method, and further explore the effects of external random carbon input rates on the most probable transition pathway, which provides a basis to recognize naturally occurring tipping points. Particularly, we investigate the effect of the transition time on the transition pathway and further compute the optimal transition time using physics informed neural network, towards the maximum carbonate concentration state in the oscillatory regimes. This work offers some insights on the effects of random carbon input on climate transition in a simple model. Key words: Onsager-Machlup action functional, the most probable transition pathway, neural shooting method, stochastic carbon cycle system. 
All the elements heavier than Fe are produced either by slow (-s) or rapid (-r) neutron-capture process. Neutron density prevailing in the stellar sites is one of the major factors that determines the type of neutron-capture processes. We present the results based on the estimates of corrected value of absolute carbon abundance, [C/N] ratio, carbon isotopic ratio and [hs/ls] ratio obtained from the high resolution spectral analysis of six stars that include both CH stars and CEMP stars. All the stars show enhancement of neutron-capture elements. Location of these objects in the A(C) vs. [Fe/H] diagram shows that they are Group I objects, with external origin of carbon and neutron-capture elements. Low values of carbon isotopic ratios estimated for these objects may also be attributed to some external sources. As the carbon isotopic ratio is a good indicator of mixing, we have used the estimates of 12C/13C ratios to examine the occurance of mixing in the stars. While the object HD 30443 might have experienced an extra mixing process that usually occurs after red giant branch (RGB) bump for stars with log(L/L0) > 2.0, the remaining objects do not show any evidence of having undergone any such mixing process. The higher values of [C/N] ratios obtained for these objects also indicate that none of these objects have experienced any strong internal mixing processes. Based on the estimated abundances of carbon and the neutron-capture elements, and the abundance ratios, we have classified the objects into different groups. While the objects HE 0110-0406, HD 30443 and CD-38 2151 are found to be CEMP-s stars, HE 0308-1612 and HD 176021 show characteristic properties of CH stars with moderate enhancement of carbon. The object CD-28 1082 with enhancement of both r- and s-process elements is found to belong to the CEMP-r/s group. 
We revisit the observed frequencies of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars as a function of the metallicity in the Galaxy, using data from the literature with available high-resolution spectroscopy. Our analysis excludes stars exhibiting clear over-abundances of neutron-capture elements, and takes into account the expected depletion of surface carbon abundance that occurs due to CN processing on the upper red-giant branch. This allows for the recovery of the initial carbon abundance of these stars, and thus for an accurate assessment of the frequencies of carbon-enhanced stars. The correction procedure we develope is based on stellar-evolution models, and depends on the surface gravity, log g, of a given star. Our analysis indicates that, for stars with [Fe/H]<=-2.0, 20% exhibit [C/Fe]>=+0.7. This fraction increases to 43% for [Fe/H]<=-3.0 and 81% for [Fe/H]<=-4.0, which is higher than have been previously inferred without taking the carbon-abundance correction into account. These CEMP-star frequencies provide important inputs for Galactic and stellar chemical-evolution models, as they constrain the evolution of carbon at early times and the possible formation channels for the CEMP-no stars. We also have developed a public online tool with which carbon corrections using our procedure can be easily obtained. 
In this paper, we propose a multi-RREH (Remote Renewable Energy Hub) based optimization framework. This framework allows a valorization of CO2 using carbon capture technologies. This valorization is grounded on the idea that CO2 gathered from the atmosphere or post combustion can be combined with hydrogen to produce synthetic methane. The hydrogen is obtained from water electrolysis using renewable energy (RE). Such renewable energy is generated in RREHs, which are locations where RE is cheap and abundant (e.g., solar PV in the Sahara Desert, or wind in Greenland). We instantiate our framework on a case study focusing on Belgium and 2 RREHs, and we conduct a techno-economic analysis. This analysis highlights the key role played by the cost of the two main carbon capture technologies: Post Combustion Carbon Capture (PCCC) and Direct Air Capture (DAC). In addition, we use our framework to derive a carbon price threshold above which carbon capture technologies may start playing a pivotal role in the decarbonation process of our industries. For example, this price threshold may give relevant information for calibrating the EU Emission Trading System so as to trigger the emergence of the multi-RREH. 
In this work, the SLM-based phase retrieval system will be used to inspect carbon reinforced plastics samples (CFRP) under applying a thermal load. For this purpose, the system is used to capture a sequence of 8 spatially separated recording planes, where the distance between subsequent planes equals 2 mm. For detecting the hidden failures two sets of intensity observations are recorded. The first set for the initial state and the second set is captured after applying the load. To recover the phase information associated with the two states, the captured intensities have been subjected to an iterative algorithm based on the method of generalized projection. 
Carbon dioxide, CO2, capture by room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) is a vivid research area featuring both accomplishments and frustrations. This work employs the PM7-MD method to simulate adsorption of CO2 by 1,3-dimethylimidazolium thiocyanate at 300 K. The obtained result evidences that the thiocyanate anion plays a key role in gas capture, whereas the impact of the 1,3-dimethylimidazolium cation is mediocre. Decomposition of the computed wave function on the individual molecular orbitals confirms that CO2-SCN binding extends beyond just expected electrostatic interactions in the ion-molecular system and involves partial sharing of valence orbitals. 
Through a careful modeling of interactions, collisions, and the catalytic behavior, one can obtain important information about the initial stage of growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), where a state-of-the-art semi-empirical Hamiltonian [Phys. Rev. B, 74, 155408 (2006)] is used to model the interaction between carbon atoms. The metal catalyst forming a supersaturated metal-alloy droplet is represented by a jellium, and the effect of collisions between the carbon atoms and the catalyst is captured by charge transfers between the jellium and the carbon. Starting from carbon clusters in different initial configurations (e.g., random structures, cage structures, bulk-cut spherical clusters, etc.), we anneal them to different temperatures. These simulations are performed with clusters placed in the jellium as well as in vacuum. We find that, in the presence of jellium, and for an optimal charge transfer of ~ 0.1 e-0.2 e, open cage structures (and some elongated cage structures) are formed, which may be viewed as precursors to the growth of SWCNTs. We will also discuss the implications of a spherical boundary on the nucleation of a SWCNT. 
An increasing amount of companies and cities plan to become CO2-neutral, which requires them to invest in renewable energies and carbon emission offsetting solutions. One of the cheapest carbon offsetting solutions is preventing deforestation in developing nations, a major contributor in global greenhouse gas emissions. However, forest preservation projects historically display an issue of trust and transparency, which drives companies to invest in transparent, but expensive air carbon capture facilities. Preservation projects could conduct accurate forest inventories (tree diameter, species, height etc.) to transparently estimate the biomass and amount of stored carbon. However, current rainforest inventories are too inaccurate, because they are often based on a few expensive ground-based samples and/or low-resolution satellite imagery. LiDAR-based solutions, used in US forests, are accurate, but cost-prohibitive, and hardly-accessible in the Amazon rainforest. We propose accurate and cheap forest inventory analyses through Deep Learning-based processing of drone imagery. The more transparent estimation of stored carbon will create higher transparency towards clients and thereby increase trust and investment into forest preservation projects. 
Unless there is immediate, unprecedented, reduction in global demand for carbon-intensive energy and products, then capture and permanent storage of billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually will be needed before mid-century to meet Paris Agreement goals. Yet competition from cheaper, temporary, carbon storage means that permanent disposal remains starved of investment, currently representing about 0.1% of Energy and Industrial Process (EIP) emissions. This stored fraction must reach 100% to stop EIPs causing global warming. Here we show that a cost-effective transition can occur by mandating an increasing stored fraction through a progressive Carbon Takeback Obligation (CTO) on fossil fuel producers and importers. Projected costs of storage to the consumer are lower than pricing carbon emissions in conventional 1.5{\deg}C scenarios until the 2040s, and comparable or lower thereafter. A CTO combined with measures to reduce CO2 production would deliver the lowest-risk pathway to achieving net zero. 
This integrated assessment modeling research analyzes what Korea's 2050 carbon neutrality would require for the national energy system and the role of the power sector concerning the availability of critical mitigation technologies. Our scenario-based assessments show that Korea's current policy falls short of what the nation's carbon-neutrality ambition would require. Across all technology scenarios examined in this study, extensive and rapid energy system transition is imperative, requiring the large-scale deployment of renewables and carbon capture & storage (CCS) early on and negative emission technologies (NETs) by the mid-century. Importantly, rapid decarbonization of the power sector that goes with rapid electrification of end-uses seems to be a robust national decarbonization strategy. Furthermore, we contextualize our net-zero scenario results using policy costs, requirements for natural resources, and the expansion rate of zero-carbon technologies. We find that the availability of nuclear power lowers the required expansion rate of renewables and CCS, alleviating any stress on terrestrial and geological systems. By contrast, the limited availability of CCS without nuclear power necessarily demands a very high penetration of renewables and significantly high policy compliance costs, which would decrease the feasibility of achieving the carbon neutrality target. 
Mineralization of carbon dioxide is often seen as an attractive alternative to classical Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, allowing the sequestration of \ce{CO2} as a solid mineral with no risk of aquifer contamination or leakage back to the atmosphere. While olivine and pyroxenes are known to easily and quickly react with dissolved \ce{CO2}, fresh peridotites are quite rare and ultramafic rocks usually contain significant amounts of serpentine, which presents a lower reactivity. The purpose of this study was then to analyze the reactivity of two natural rocks: a partially serpentinized lherzolite and a fully altered serpentinite. Results confirm that serpentine is much slower to react and gets altered only if the activity of \ce{CO2} is high enough and if all olivine and pyroxenes have already been consumed. Resulting carbonates are mostly Mg-rich calcite or Mg-depleted dolomite with the occurrence of eitelite (\ce{Na2Mg(CO3)2} in the case of high Na activities. The carbonation of these serpentinite was however associated in some cases with a heavy precipitation of hazardous asbestiform chrysotile, which could be a potential threat for engineered carbonation processes. 
Large-scale applications are waiting for an optimal CO2 scavenger to reinforce CCS and CCU technologies. We herein introduce and succinctly validate a new philosophy of capturing gaseous CO2 by negatively-charged carbonaceous structures. The chemical absorption of CO2 turns out possible thanks to the emergence of significant nucleophilic interaction carbon centers upon applying voltage. The carbonaceous cathode, therefore, may serve as a prototype of a new CO2 sorbent. As a model to simulate chemisorption, we used a small-sized graphene quantum dot (GQD). According to the recorded reaction profiles, the negatively charged GQD containing 16 carbon atoms readily reacts with the CO2 molecule and produces carboxylated GQD. In turn, the activation energy (60 kJ/mol) and energy effect (-55 kJ/mol) for the reaction in water appeared surprisingly competitive in the context of the literature. We hypothesize that the carbonaceous cathode deserves in-depth experimental research as a possible CO2 chemical sorbent. Despite we used GQD for simulations, the encouraging results can be extrapolated to other nanoscale carbons and, more importantly, to the activated carbon species widely employed in modern electrochemical devices. 
The widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) across various industries has raised sustainability concerns due to its substantial energy usage and carbon emissions. This issue becomes more pressing in adversarial ML, which focuses on enhancing model security against different network-based attacks. Implementing defenses in ML systems often necessitates additional computational resources and network security measures, exacerbating their environmental impacts. In this paper, we pioneer the first investigation into adversarial ML's carbon footprint, providing empirical evidence connecting greater model robustness to higher emissions. Addressing the critical need to quantify this trade-off, we introduce the Robustness Carbon Trade-off Index (RCTI). This novel metric, inspired by economic elasticity principles, captures the sensitivity of carbon emissions to changes in adversarial robustness. We demonstrate the RCTI through an experiment involving evasion attacks, analyzing the interplay between robustness against attacks, performance, and carbon emissions. 
A novel system containing nanoporous materials and carbonate ions is proposed, which is capable to capture CO2 from ambient air simply by controlling the amount of water (humidity) in the system. The system absorbs CO2 from the air when the surrounding is dry, whereas desorbs CO2 when wet. A design of such a CO2 absorption/desorption system is investigated in this paper using molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics simulations, and also verified by experiments. Its working mechanism is revealed as the reduction of free energy of the carbonate ion hydrolysis with the decrease of the number of water molecules in confined nano-pores. The influences of pore size, spacing of cations, surface hydrophobicity and temperature on CO2 capture efficiency are elucidated. The study may help to design an efficient direct air capture system and contribute to the negative carbon emission. 
Oxy-fuel carbon capture in power plants is a relatively new concept aiming at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the plants. This is achieved by burning the fossil fuel using oxygen as oxidizer with no nitrogen, thereby rendering the exhaust gases very rich in carbon dioxide (after condensing water vapor by cooling), which facilitates its capture for environmental or commercial purposes. Despite the worldwide interest in oxy-fuel carbon capture, its progress is at risk given the large energy needed to separate oxygen from air in order to provide the oxidizer, thereby hindering further progress of this concept toward large-scale applications. This paper focuses on alleviating this drawback of oxy-fuel combustion by making it more attractive through combining it with another concept, namely magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generators. The end product is a power plant operating on a combined cycle composed of a topping MHD ultra-high-temperature cycle with direct electricity extraction from plasma, followed by a bottoming steam cycle with conventional turbo-generators. Different design aspects and simplified technical analysis for the MHD generator are presented. 
We present an experimental technique for determining the pH and the total carbon concentration when \ch{CO2} diffuses and flows in water. The technique employs three different pH indicators, which, when combined with an image analysis technique, provides a dynamic range in pH from 4.0 to 9.5. In contrast to usual techniques in which a single pH indicator is used, the methodology presented allows not only to produce a binary classification (pH larger or smaller than a given threshold) but to access a much more complete continuous spatial distribution of pH and concentration levels in the system. We calibrate the method against benchmark solutions and further demonstrate its potential by measuring the pH and total carbon concentration in a density driven convection (DDC) of carbon-enriched water. The motivation for testing the method in this particular experiment comes from the fact that DDC plays a pivotal role in the efficiency of engineered carbon storage processes. The application of the technique presented here provided a direct window for the analysis of the spatial distribution of captured carbon in the DDC flow. 
We study how the climate transition through a low-carbon economy, implemented by carbon pricing, propagates in a credit portfolio and precisely describe how carbon price dynamics affects credit risk measures such as probability of default, expected and unexpected losses. We adapt a stochastic multisectoral model to take into account the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions costs of both sectoral firms' production and consumption, as well as sectoral household's consumption. GHG emissions costs are the product of carbon prices, provided by the NGFS transition scenarios, and of GHG emissions. For each sector, our model yields the sensitivity of firms' production and households' consumption to carbon price and the relationships between sectors. It allows us to analyze the short-term effects of the carbon price as opposed to standard IAM (such as REMIND), which are deterministic and only capture long-term trends. Finally, we use a DCF methodology to compute firms' values which we then combine with a structural credit risk model to describe how the carbon price impacts credit risk measures. We obtain that the carbon price distorts the distribution of the firm's value, increases banking fees charged to clients (materialized by the bank provisions), and reduces banks' profitability (translated by the economic capital). In addition, the randomness we introduce provides extra flexibility to take into account uncertainties on the productivity and on the different transition scenarios. We also compute the sensitivities of the credit risk measures with respect to changes in the carbon price, yielding further criteria for a more accurate assessment of climate transition risk in a credit portfolio. This work provides a preliminary methodology to calculate the evolution of credit risk measures of a credit portfolio, starting from a given climate transition scenario described by a carbon price. 
Climate science is critical for understanding both the causes and consequences of changes in global temperatures and has become imperative for decisive policy-making. However, climate science studies commonly require addressing complex interoperability issues between data, software, and experimental approaches from multiple fields. Scientific workflow systems provide unparalleled advantages to address these issues, including reproducibility of experiments, provenance capture, software reusability and knowledge sharing. In this paper, we introduce a novel workflow with a series of connected components to perform spatial data preparation, classification of satellite imagery with machine learning algorithms, and assessment of carbon stored by urban trees. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that estimates carbon storage for a region in Africa following the guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 
Direct fired supercritical CO2 (sCO2) power cycles allow for the combustion of gaseous fuels under oxyfuel conditions with inherent carbon capture. As the CO2 is captured intrinsically, the efficiency penalty of capture on the overall plant is small, meaning that power plants achieve a similar efficiency to traditional fossil fuel power plants without carbon capture and storage. However, at high pressures and in large dilutions of CO2, combustion mechanisms are poorly understood. Therefore, in this paper sensitivity and quantitative analysis of four established chemical kinetic mechanisms have been employed to determine the most important reactions and the best performing mechanisms over a range of different conditions. CH3O2 chemistry was identified as a pivotal mechanism component for modelling methane combustion above 200 atm. The University of Sheffield (UoS) sCO2 mechanism created in the present work better models the ignition delay time (IDT) of high-pressure combustion in a large dilution of CO2. Quantitative analysis showed that the UoS sCO2 mechanism was the best fit to the greatest number of IDT datasets and had the lowest average absolute error value, thus indicating a superior performance compared to the four existing chemical kinetic mechanisms, well-validated for lower pressure conditions. 
We explore the effects of the residual $\mathrm{^{12}C}$ present in oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONe WDs) on their evolution towards accretion-induced collapse (AIC). We produce a set of ONe WD models using MESA and illustrate how the amount and location of the residual carbon depends on the initial mass of the star and assumptions about rotation and convective overshooting. We find a wide range of possible $\mathrm{^{12}C}$ mass fractions roughly ranging from 0.1 to 10 per cent. Convection and thermohaline mixing that occurs as the ONe WDs cool leads to nearly homogeneous interior compositions by the time that AIC would occur. We evolve these ONe WD models and some toy WD models towards AIC and find that regardless of the carbon fraction, the occurrence of Urca-process cooling due to $\mathrm{^{23}Na}$ implies that the models are unlikely to reach carbon ignition before electron captures on $\mathrm{^{24}Mg}$ occur. Difficulties associated with modeling electron-capture-driven convective regions in these ONe WDs prevent us from evolving our MESA models all the way to thermonuclear oxygen ignition and the onset of collapse. Thus, firm conclusions about the effect of carbon on the final fates of these objects await improved modeling. However, it is clear that the inclusion of residual carbon can shift the evolution from that previously described in the literature and should be included in future models. 
Carbon dioxide fixation and storage constitute a drastically important problem for the humanity nowadays. We hereby publish a new solution based on the alkaline earth salts with a weakly coordinating anion, tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. The proposed solution was validated using a robust combination of global minimum search and molecular dynamics simulations utilizing a well-tested, reliable semiempirical Hamiltonian to monitor chemical reactions. Calcium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate captures 5.5 CO2 molecules per mole, whereas barium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate captures 3.6 CO2 molecules per mole. These capacities are much higher, as compared to the established carbonate technology, which fixes only one CO2 molecule per one metal atom. The conducted simulations reveal that electrostatic binding of CO2 to alkaline earth cations is more technologically interesting than formation of carbonate salts. Our simulation results can be directly validated by sorption measurements. 
The carbon-capturing process with the aid of CO2 removal technology (CDRT) has been recognised as an alternative and a prominent approach to deep decarbonisation. However, the main hindrance is the enormous energy demand and the economic implication of CDRT if not effectively managed. Hence, a novel deep reinforcement learning agent (DRL), integrated with an automated hyperparameter selection feature, is proposed in this study for the real-time scheduling of a multi-energy system coupled with CDRT. Post-carbon capture systems (PCCS) and direct-air capture systems (DACS) are considered CDRT. Various possible configurations are evaluated using real-time multi-energy data of a district in Arizona and CDRT parameters from manufacturers' catalogues and pilot project documentation. The simulation results validate that an optimised soft-actor critic (SAC) algorithm outperformed the TD3 algorithm due to its maximum entropy feature. We then trained four (4) SAC agents, equivalent to the number of considered case studies, using optimised hyperparameter values and deployed them in real time for evaluation. The results show that the proposed DRL agent can meet the prosumers' multi-energy demand and schedule the CDRT energy demand economically without specified constraints violation. Also, the proposed DRL agent outperformed rule-based scheduling by 23.65%. However, the configuration with PCCS and solid-sorbent DACS is considered the most suitable configuration with a high CO2 captured-released ratio of 38.54, low CO2 released indicator value of 2.53, and a 36.5% reduction in CDR cost due to waste heat utilisation and high absorption capacity of the selected sorbent. However, the adoption of CDRT is not economically viable at the current carbon price. Finally, we showed that CDRT would be attractive at a carbon price of 400-450USD/ton with the provision of tax incentives by the policymakers. 
Dissolution of CO$_2$ in water followed by the subsequent hydrolysis reactions is of great importance to the global carbon cycle, and carbon capture and storage. Despite enormous previous studies, the reactions are still not fully understood at the atomistic scale. Here, we combined ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with Markov state models to elucidate the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of CO$_2$ in supercritical water both in the bulk and nanoconfined states. The integration of unsupervised learning with first-principles data allows us to identify complex reaction coordinates and pathways automatically instead of a priori human speculation. Interestingly, our unbiased modelling found a novel pathway of dissolving CO$_2$(aq) under graphene nanoconfinement, involving the pyrocarbonate anion (C$_2$O$_5^{2-}$(aq)) as an intermediate state. The pyrocarbonate anion was previously hypothesized to have a fleeting existence in water; however our study reveals that it is a crucial reaction intermediate and stable carbon species in the nanoconfined solutions. We even observed the formation of pyrocarbonic acid (H$_2$C$_2$O$_5$(aq)), which was unknown in water. The unexpected appearance of pyrocarbonates is related to the superionic behavior of the confined solutions. We also found that carbonation reactions involve collective proton transfer along transient water wires, which exhibits concerted behavior in the bulk solution but proceeds stepwise under nanoconfinement. Our study highlights the importance of large oxocarbons in aqueous carbon reactions, with great implications for the deep carbon cycle and the sequestration of CO$_2$. 
We introduce a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for atomistic simulations of liquid and amorphous elemental carbon. Based on a machine-learning representation of the density-functional theory (DFT) potential-energy surface, such interatomic potentials enable materials simulations with close-to DFT accuracy but at much lower computational cost. We first determine the maximum accuracy that any finite-range potential can achieve in carbon structures; then, using a novel hierarchical set of two-, three-, and many-body structural descriptors, we construct a GAP model that can indeed reach the target accuracy. The potential yields accurate energetic and structural properties over a wide range of densities; it also correctly captures the structure of the liquid phases, at variance with state-of-the-art empirical potentials. Exemplary applications of the GAP model to surfaces of "diamond-like" tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) are presented, including an estimate of the amorphous material's surface energy, and simulations of high-temperature surface reconstructions ("graphitization"). The new interatomic potential appears to be promising for realistic and accurate simulations of nanoscale amorphous carbon structures. 
Sustainable development and the recent fast growing global demands for energy and functional chemicals urgently call for effective methods for CO2 remediation and efficient metal-free catalysts for selective oxidation of aromatic alcohol. Herein, a unique main-chain poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) is employed as the precursor to prepare nitrogen doped micro and mesoporous carbons via simultaneous carbonization and activation, which bear high yield, large specific surface area above 1700 m2 per g and rich nitrogen dopant. The porous carbon products deliver a high CO2 adsorption capacity up to 6.2 mmol per g at 273 K and 1 bar with outstanding reversibility and satisfactory selectivity. Besides, they work excellently as metal free carbocatalysts for the selective aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde with high selectivity. It is believed that this work not only provides a facile approach to prepare nitrogen-doped porous carbon, but also advances the related research in the fields of environment and catalysis. 
Much emotion is expended on the dangers of carbon dioxide, but solutions require reason and recognition of facts: (1) The cost of developing options is approximately a thousand times less than their deployment. (2) Timescales involve two questions: (a) How quickly can an option be demonstrated? (b) How quickly can the required equivalent of thousands of units be built. Two questions are implied: (1) What options would most fundamentally change the carbon-dioxide problem? (2) For each option, how could it be demonstrated most quickly? An option of fundamental importance is direct air capture of carbon dioxide. The option that appears most attractive for carbon-free energy production is the stellarator fusion concept, which is poised for a rapid demonstration. 
Carbonated water flooding (CWI) increases oil production due to favorable dissolution effects and viscosity reduction. Accurate modeling of CWI performance requires a simulator with the ability to capture the true physics of such process. In this study, compositional modeling coupled with surface complexation modeling (SCM) are done, allowing a unified study of the influence in oil recovery of reduction of salt concentration in water. The compositional model consists of the conservation equations of total carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, chloride and decane. The coefficients of such equations are obtained from the equilibrium partition of chemical species that are soluble both in oleic and the aqueous phases. SCM is done by using the PHREEQC program, which determines concentration of the master species. Estimation of the wettability as a function of the Total Bound Product (TBP) that takes into account the concentration of the complexes in the aqueous, oleic phases and in the rock walls is performed. We solve analytically and numerically these equations in $1-$D in order to elucidate the effects of the injection of low salinity carbonated water into a reservoir containing oil equilibrated with high salinity carbonated water. 
Over the past decade, the continuous surge in cloud computing demand has intensified data center workloads, leading to significant carbon emissions and driving the need for improving their efficiency and sustainability. This paper focuses on the optimal allocation problem of batch compute loads with temporal and spatial flexibility across a global network of data centers. We propose a bilevel game-theoretic solution approach that captures the inherent hierarchical relationship between supervisory control objectives, such as carbon reduction and peak shaving, and operational objectives, such as priority-aware scheduling. Numerical simulations with real carbon intensity data demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully reduces carbon emissions while simultaneously ensuring operational reliability and priority-aware scheduling. 
Due to their tunable material properties, sorptive materials have a wide range of applications in energy storage, water treatment, carbon capture, analytical chemistry, and more. One crucial factor in determining the effectiveness of such materials is their skeletal density, or "true density" because it is often used to calculate key metrics, such as storage capacities. In this paper, we present skeletal density measurements through helium pycnometry for several types of adsorbent carbon materials derived from either corncob, sawdust, coffee grounds, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), graphitic carbon nitride (GCN), or metal organic frameworks (MOFs). The measured skeletal density of sawdust-based activated carbon was 2.02 +/- 0.05 g/$cm^{ 3}$. The measured skeletal density of coffee-based activated carbon was 2.23 +/- 0.06 $cm^{ 3}$. We also expound upon the impact that skeletal density has upon hydrogen excess adsorption measurements and other calculated engineering quantities. If a skeletal density is underestimated by 10%, it can affect the room temperature excess adsorption by at least 5% at 100 bar and by 7% at 200 bar, depending on the material type. 
We describe a new principle - the Alkalinity Concentration Swing (ACS) - for direct air capture of carbon dioxide driven by concentrating an alkaline solution that has been exposed to the atmosphere and loaded with dissolved inorganic carbon. Upon concentration, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide increases, allowing for extraction and compression. We find that higher concentration factors result in proportionally higher outgassing pressure, and higher initial alkalinity concentrations at the same concentration factor outgas a higher concentration of CO2 relative to the feed solution. We examine two desalination technologies, reverse osmosis and capacitive deionization, as possible implementation for the ACS, and evaluate two simplified corresponding energy models. We compare the ACS to incumbent technologies and make estimates on water, land, and energy requirements for capturing one million tonnes of CO2 per year. We find that estimates for the lower end of the energy range for both reverse osmosis and capacitive deionization approaches are lower than or roughly equal to incumbent direct air capture approaches. For most conditions, we find an inverse relationship between the required energy and water processing volume per million tonnes of CO2. Realizing the ACS requires a simple alkaline aqueous solvent (e.g. potassium alkalinity carrier) and does not require heat as a driving mechanism. More generally, the ACS can be implemented through industrial-scale desalination approaches, meaning current technology could be leveraged for scale-up. 
Over the past decade, climate change has become an increasing problem with one of the major contributing factors being carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions; almost 51% of total US carbon emissions are from factories. Current materials used in CO2 capture are lacking either in efficiency, sustainability, or cost.   Electrocatalysis of CO2 is a new approach where CO2 can be reduced and the components used industrially as fuel, saving transportation costs, creating financial incentives. Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are crystals made of organo-metals that adsorb, filter, and electrocatalyze CO2. The current available MOFs for capture & electrocatalysis are expensive to manufacture and inefficient at capture. The goal therefore is to computationally design a MOF that can adsorb CO2 and catalyze carbon monoxide & oxygen with low cost.   A novel active transfer learning neural network was developed, utilizing transfer learning due to limited available data on 15 MOFs. Using the Cambridge Structural Database with 10,000 MOFs, the model used incremental mutations to fit a trained fitness hyper-heuristic function. Eventually, a Selenium MOF (C18MgO25Se11Sn20Zn5) was converged on. Through analysis of predictions & literature, the converged MOF was shown to be more effective & more synthetically accessible than existing MOFs, showing the model had an understanding of effective electrocatalytic structures in the material space. This novel network can be implemented for other gas separations and catalysis applications that have limited training accessible datasets. 
We study the mitigation of climate tipping point transitions using an energy balance model. The evolution of the global mean surface temperature is coupled with the CO2 concentration through the green house effect. We model the CO2 concentration with a stochastic delay differential equation (SDDE), accounting for various carbon emission and capture scenarios. The resulting coupled system of SDDEs exhibits a tipping point phenomena: if CO2 concentration exceeds a critical threshold (around 478ppm), the temperature experiences an abrupt increase of about six degrees Celsius. We show that the CO2 concentration exhibits a transient growth which may cause a climate tipping point, even if the concentration decays asymptotically. We derive a rigorous upper bound for the CO2 evolution which quantifies its transient and asymptotic growths, and provides sufficient conditions for evading the climate tipping point. Combining this upper bound with Monte Carlo simulations of the stochastic climate model, we investigate the emission reduction and carbon capture scenarios that would avert the tipping point. 
The extra CO2 that has already been released into the atmosphere has to be removed in order to create a world that is carbon neutral. Technologies have been created to remove carbon dioxide from wet flue gas or even directly from ambient air, however these technologies are not widely deployed yet. New generations of creative CO2 capture sorbents have been produced as a consequence of recent improvements in material assembly and surface chemistry. We summarize recent progress on water-stable and encapsulated metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for CO2 capture under a wide range of environmental and operating conditions. In particular, newly developed water-stable MOFs and hydrophobic coating technologies are discussed with insights into their materials discovery and the synergistic effects between different components of these hybrid sorbent systems. The future perspectives and directions of water-stable and encapsulated MOFs are also given for Direct Air Capture of CO2 and CO2 capture from wet flue gas. 
We present the first detailed chemical abundance study of the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Tucana II based on high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra of four red giant stars. The metallicity of these stars ranges from [Fe/H] = -3.2 to -2.6, and all stars are low in neutron-capture abundances ([Sr/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] < -1). However, a number of anomalous chemical signatures are present. Three stars are carbon-enhanced, including the most metal-rich star. This star ([Fe/H]=-2.6) shows [Na,$\alpha$,Sc/Fe] < 0, suggesting an extended star formation history with contributions from AGB stars and Type Ia supernovae. The other carbon-enhanced stars have [Fe/H] < -3 and may be consistent with enrichment by faint supernovae, if such supernovae can produce neutron-capture elements. A fourth star with [Fe/H] = -3 is carbon-normal, and exhibits distinct light element abundance ratios from the carbon-enhanced stars. The carbon-normal star implies that at least two distinct nucleosynthesis sources, both possibly associated with Population III stars, contributed to the early chemical enrichment of this galaxy. Despite its very low luminosity, Tucana II shows a diversity of chemical signatures that preclude it from being a simple "one-shot" first galaxy, but still provide a window to star and galaxy formation in the early universe. 
STEP (Solar Thermal Electrochemical Production) is an alternative solar energy conversion process. New and original, unpublished STEP results are compared with other STEP results. The STEP process uses semiconductors, solar energy and electrochemistry to generate a wide range of useful chemicals, rather than electricity, as the product. Using both subgap (to generate heat) and super bandgap (to generate electrons) insolation, STEP is more efficient than either photovoltaic or photoelectochemical solar energy conversion. STEP theory is derived and experimentally verified for the electrosynthesis of energetic molecules at high solar energy efficiency. In STEP the efficient formation of metals, fuels, chlorine, and carbon capture is driven by solar thermal heated electrolyses occuring at voltage below that of the room temperature energy stored in the products. As one example, CO2 is reduced to either fuels, or storable carbon, at solar efficiency over 50% due to a synergy of efficient solar thermal absorption and electrochemical conversion at high temperature and reactant concentration. CO2 is efficiently transformed to carbon nanotubes (C2CNT) with or without solar energy. New results on CO2-free STEP ammonia, iron and cement production are delineated. Water is efficiently split to H2 by molten electrolysis. A pathway is provided for the STEP decrease of atmospheric CO2 levels to pre-industial levels in 10 years. 
Carbon can exist as isolated dumbbell, one-dimensional (1D) chain, 2D plane, and 3D network in carbon solids or carbon-based compounds, which attributes to its rich chemical binding way, including sp-, sp2-, and sp3-hybridized bonds. Sp2 hybridizing carbon always captures special attention due to its unique physical and chemical property. Here, using evolutionary algorithm in conjunction with ab initio method, we found that under compression, dumbbell carbon in CaC2 can be polymerized firstly into one-dimensional chain and then into ribbon and further into two dimensional graphite sheet at higher pressure. The C2m structure transforms into an orthorhombic Cmcm phase at 0.5 GPa, followed by another orthorhombic Immm phase, which is stabilized at wide pressure range of 15.2-105.8 GPa and then forced into MgB2-type phase with wide range stability up to at least 1 TPa. Strong electron-phonon coupling in cold compressed CaC2 is found, in particular for Immm phase, which has the highest lambda value (0.562-0.564) among them, leading to its high superconducting critical temperature (7.9~9.8 K), wihich is comparable to 11.5K value of CaC6. Our research results show that calcium can not only stabilize carbon sp2 hybridization at larger range of pressure but make them present superconducting behavior, which would further ignite experimental and theoretical research interests on Alkali-Earth metal carbides to uncover their peculiar physical properties under extreme conditions. 
We present the first map of carbonicity, [C/Fe], for the halo system of the Milky Way, based on a sample of over 100,000 main-sequence turnoff stars with available spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This map, which explores distances up to 15 kpc from the Sun, reveals clear evidence for the dual nature of the Galactic halo, based on the spatial distribution of stellar carbonicity. The metallicity distribution functions of stars in the inner- and outer-halo regions of the carbonicity map reproduce those previously argued to arise from contributions of the inner- and outer-halo populations, with peaks at [Fe/H] = -1.5 and -2.2, respectively. From consideration of the absolute carbon abundances for our sample, A(C), we also confirm that the carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the outer-halo region exhibit a higher frequency of CEMP-no stars (those with no overabundances of heavy neutron-capture elements) than of CEMP-s stars (those with strong overabundances of elements associated with the s-process), whereas the stars in the inner-halo region exhibit a higher frequency of CEMP-s stars. We argue that the contrast in the behavior of the CEMP-no and CEMP-s fractions in these regions arises from differences in the mass distributions of the mini-halos from which the stars of the inner- and outer-halo populations formed, which gives rise in turn to the observed dichotomy of the Galactic halo. 
With our new Ca-CN-CH-NH photometry, we revisit the globular cluster (GC) M5. We find that M5 is a mono-metallic GC with a small metallicity dispersion. Our carbon abundances show that the $\sigma$[C/Fe] of the M5 CN-s population, with depleted carbon and enhanced nitrogen abundances, is significantly large for a single stellar population. Our new analysis reveals that the M5 CN-s population is well described by the two stellar populations: the CN-s$_{\rm I}$, being the major CN-s component, with the intermediate carbon and nitrogen abundance and the CN-s$_{\rm E}$ with the most carbon-poor and nitrogen-rich abundance. We find that the CN-s$_{\rm E}$ is significantly more centrally concentrated than the others, while CN-w and CN-s$_{\rm I}$ have similar cumulative radial distributions. The red giant branch bump $V$ magnitude, the helium abundance barometer in mono-metallic populations, of individual populations appears to be correlated with their mean carbon abundance, indicating that carbon abundances are anticorrelated with helium abundances. We propose that the CN-s$_{\rm E}$ formed out of gas that experienced proton-capture processes at high temperatures in the innermost region of the proto-GC of M5 that resided in a dense ambient density environment. Shortly after, the CN-s$_{\rm I}$ formed out of gas diluted from the pristine gas in the more spatially extended region, consistent with the current development of numerical simulations by others. 
Delivering low-carbon heat will require the substitution of natural gas with low-carbon alternatives such as electricity and hydrogen. The objective of this paper is to develop a method to soft-link two advanced, investment-optimising energy system models, RTN (Resource-Technology Network) and WeSIM (Whole-electricity System Investment Model), in order to assess cost-efficient heat decarbonisation pathways for the UK while utilising the respective strengths of the two models. The linking procedure included passing on hourly electricity prices from WeSIM as input to RTN, and returning capacities and locations of hydrogen generation and shares of electricity and hydrogen in heat supply from RTN to WeSIM. The outputs demonstrate that soft-linking can improve the quality of the solution, while providing useful insights into the cost-efficient pathways for zero-carbon heating. Quantitative results point to the cost-effectiveness of using a mix of electricity and hydrogen technologies for delivering zero-carbon heat, also demonstrating a high level of interaction between electricity and hydrogen infrastructure in a zero-carbon system. Hydrogen from gas reforming with carbon capture and storage can play a significant role in the medium term, while remaining a cost-efficient option for supplying peak heat demand in the longer term, with the bulk of heat demand being supplied by electric heat pumps. 
(1) Introduction: New technologies that leverage gas hydrates phenomena include carbon capture and sequestrations. These processes are often semi-continuous and require regulation of the system's flow properties for proper operation. Accurate computational models for the viscosity of carbon dioxide hydrate systems at pre-nucleation conditions can be important for process design and control of such technologies. (2) Methods: This work validates the viscosity predictions of molecular dynamics simulations using previously measured experimental data. The TIP4P/Ice force field was used to model water, while the EPM2, TraPPE, and Zhang force fields were used for carbon dioxide. The Green-Kubo and Einstein formulations of viscosity and diffusivity were used in this work. (3) Results: All force fields overpredicted viscosity when compared to experimental data, but EPM2 resulted in lower discrepancies. Additionally, EPM2 was determined to model molecular behavior expected from the macroscopic trends in viscosity with respect to temperature and pressure. (4) Conclusions: The EPM2 force field more accurately predicted the viscosity of carbon dioxide hydrates systems at pre-nucleation conditions relative to TraPPE and Zhang. 
Putting a price on carbon -- with taxes or developing carbon markets -- is a widely used policy measure to achieve the target of net-zero emissions by 2050. This paper tackles the issue of producing point, direction-of-change, and density forecasts for the monthly real price of carbon within the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). We aim to uncover supply- and demand-side forces that can contribute to improving the prediction accuracy of models at short- and medium-term horizons. We show that a simple Bayesian Vector Autoregressive (BVAR) model, augmented with either one or two factors capturing a set of predictors affecting the price of carbon, provides substantial accuracy gains over a wide set of benchmark forecasts, including survey expectations and forecasts made available by data providers. We extend the study to verified emissions and demonstrate that, in this case, adding stochastic volatility can further improve the forecasting performance of a single-factor BVAR model. We rely on emissions and price forecasts to build market monitoring tools that track demand and price pressure in the EU ETS market. Our results are relevant for policymakers and market practitioners interested in monitoring the carbon market dynamics. 
Accounting for over 20% of the total carbon emissions, the precise estimation of on-road transportation carbon emissions is crucial for carbon emission monitoring and efficient mitigation policy formulation. However, existing estimation methods typically depend on hard-to-collect individual statistics of vehicle miles traveled to calculate emissions, thereby suffering from high data collection difficulty. To relieve this issue by utilizing the strong pattern recognition of artificial intelligence, we incorporate two sources of open data representative of the transportation demand and capacity factors, the origin-destination (OD) flow data and the road network data, to build a hierarchical heterogeneous graph learning method for on-road carbon emission estimation (HENCE). Specifically, a hierarchical graph consisting of the road network level, community level, and region level is constructed to model the multi-scale road network-based connectivity and travel connection between spatial areas. Heterogeneous graphs consisting of OD links and spatial links are further built at both the community level and region level to capture the intrinsic interactions between travel demand and road network accessibility. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate HENCE's effectiveness and superiority with R-squared exceeding 0.75 and outperforming baselines by 9.60% on average, validating its success in pioneering the use of artificial intelligence to empower carbon emission management and sustainability development. The implementation codes are available at this link: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/HENCE. 
Carbon stars, enhanced in carbon and neutron-capture elements, provide wealth of information about the nucleosynthesis history of the Galaxy. In this work, we present the first ever detailed abundance analysis of carbon star LAMOSTJ091608.81+230734.6 and a detailed abundance analysis of neutron-capture elements for the object LAMOSTJ151003.74+305407.3. Updates on the abundances of elements C, O, Mg, Ca, Cr, Mn and Ni for LAMOSTJ151003.74+305407.3 are also presented. Our analysis is based on high resolution spectra obtained using Hanle Echelle Spectrograph (HESP) attached to the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), IAO, Hanle. The stellar atmospheric parameters (T$_{eff}$, logg, micro-turbulance ${\zeta}$, metallicity [Fe/H]) are found to be (4820, 1.43, 1.62, $-$0.89) and (4500, 1.55, 1.24, $-$1.57) for these two objects respectively. The abundance estimates of several elements, C, N, O, Na, $\alpha$-elements, Fe-peak elements and neutron-capture elements Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Eu are presented. Our analysis shows the star LAMOSTJ151003.74+305407.3 to be a CEMP-r/s star, and LAMOSTJ091608.81+230734.6 a CH giant. We have examined if the i-process model yields ([X/Fe]) of heavy elements could explain the observed abundances of the CEMP-r/s star based on a parametric model based analysis. The negative values obtained for the neutron density dependent [Rb/Zr] ratio confirm former low-mass AGB companions for both the stars. Kinematic analysis shows that LAMOSTJ151003.74+305407.3 belongs to the Galactic halo population and LAMOSTJ091608.81+230734.6 to the disc population. 
Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Sequestration (BECCS) is critical for stringent climate change mitigation, but is commercially and technologically immature and resource-intensive. In California, state and federal fuel and climate policies can drive first-markets for BECCS. We develop a spatially explicit optimization model to assess niche markets for renewable natural gas (RNG) production with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) from waste biomass in California. Existing biomass residues produce biogas and RNG and enable low-cost CCS through the upgrading process and CO$_2$ truck transport. Under current state and federal policy incentives, we could capture and sequester 2.9 million MT CO$_2$/year (0.7% of California's 2018 CO$_2$ emissions) and produce 93 PJ RNG/year (4% of California's 2018 natural gas demand) with a profit maximizing objective. Existing federal and state policies produce profits of \$11/GJ. Distributed RNG production with CCS potentially catalyzes markets and technologies for CO$_2$ capture, transport, and storage in California. 
Carbon nanotubes continue to be model systems for studies of confinement and interactions. This is particularly true in the case of so-called "ultra-clean" carbon nanotube devices offering the study of quantum dots with extremely low disorder. The quality of such systems, however, has increasingly revealed glaring discrepancies between experiment and theory. Here we address the outstanding anomaly of exceptionally large orbital magnetic moments in carbon nanotube quantum dots. We perform low temperature magneto-transport measurements of the orbital magnetic moment and find it is up to seven times larger than expected from the conventional semiclassical model. Moreover, the magnitude of the magnetic moment monotonically drops with the addition of each electron to the quantum dot directly contradicting the widely accepted shell filling picture of single-particle levels. We carry out quasiparticle calculations, both from first principles and within the effective-mass approximation, and find the giant magnetic moments can only be captured by considering a self-energy correction to the electronic band structure due to electron-electron interactions. 
Theoretical models predict the condensation of silicon carbide around host stars with C/O ratios higher than 0.65 (cf. C/O$_{\mathrm{Sun}}$ = 0.54), in addition to its observations in meteorites, interstellar medium and protoplanetary disks. Consequently, the interiors of rocky exoplanets born from carbon-enriched refractory material are often assumed to contain large amounts of silicon carbide. Here we aim to investigate the stability of silicon carbide in the interior of carbon-enriched rocky exoplanets and to derive the reaction leading to its transformation. We performed a high-pressure high-temperature experiment to investigate the reaction between a silicon carbide layer and a layer representative of the bulk composition of a carbon-enriched rocky exoplanet. We report the reaction leading to oxidation of silicon carbide producing quartz, graphite, and molten iron silicide. Combined with previous studies, we show that in order to stabilize silicon carbide, carbon saturation is not sufficient, and a complete reduction of Fe$^{2+}$ to Fe$^{0}$ in a planetary mantle is required, suggesting that future spectroscopic detection of Fe$^{2+}$ or Fe$^{3+}$ on the surface of rocky exoplanets would imply the absence of silicon carbide in their interiors. 
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can aid decarbonization of the atmosphere to limit further global temperature increases. A framework utilizing unsupervised learning is used to generate a range of subsurface geologic volumes to investigate potential sites for long-term storage of carbon dioxide. Generative adversarial networks are used to create geologic volumes, with a further neural network used to sample the posterior distribution of a trained Generator conditional to sparsely sampled physical measurements. These generative models are further conditioned to historic dynamic fluid flow data through Bayesian inversion to improve the resolution of the forecast of the storage capacity of injected carbon dioxide. 
To combat global warming and mitigate the risks associated with climate change, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has emerged as a crucial technology. However, safely sequestering CO2 in geological formations for long-term storage presents several challenges. In this study, we address these issues by modeling the decision-making process for carbon storage operations as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We solve the POMDP using belief state planning to optimize injector and monitoring well locations, with the goal of maximizing stored CO2 while maintaining safety. Empirical results in simulation demonstrate that our approach is effective in ensuring safe long-term carbon storage operations. We showcase the flexibility of our approach by introducing three different monitoring strategies and examining their impact on decision quality. Additionally, we introduce a neural network surrogate model for the POMDP decision-making process to handle the complex dynamics of the multi-phase flow. We also investigate the effects of different fidelity levels of the surrogate model on decision qualities. 
In recent years, large-scale auto-regressive models have made significant progress in various tasks, such as text or video generation. However, the environmental impact of these models has been largely overlooked, with a lack of assessment and analysis of their carbon footprint. To address this gap, we introduce OpenCarbonEval, a unified framework for integrating large-scale models across diverse modalities to predict carbon emissions, which could provide AI service providers and users with a means to estimate emissions beforehand and help mitigate the environmental pressure associated with these models. In OpenCarbonEval, we propose a dynamic throughput modeling approach that could capture workload and hardware fluctuations in the training process for more precise emissions estimates. Our evaluation results demonstrate that OpenCarbonEval can more accurately predict training emissions than previous methods, and can be seamlessly applied to different modal tasks. Specifically, we show that OpenCarbonEval achieves superior performance in predicting carbon emissions for both visual models and language models. By promoting sustainable AI development and deployment, OpenCarbonEval can help reduce the environmental impact of large-scale models and contribute to a more environmentally responsible future for the AI community. 
In the pursuit of a carbon-neutral future, hydrogen emerges as a pivotal element, serving as a carbon-free energy carrier and feedstock. As efforts to decarbonize sectors such as heating and transportation intensify, understanding and navigating through the dynamics of hydrogen demand expansion becomes critical. Transitioning to hydrogen economy is complicated by varying regional scales and types of hydrogen demand, with forecasts indicating a rise in variable demand that calls for diverse production technologies. Currently, steam methane reforming is prevalent, but its significant carbon emissions make a shift to cleaner alternatives like blue and green hydrogen imperative. Each production method possesses distinct characteristics, necessitating a thorough exploration and co-optimization with electricity supply chains as well as carbon capture, utilization, and storage systems. Our study fills existing research gaps by introducing a superstructure optimization framework that accommodates various demand scenarios and technologies. Through case studies in California, we underscore the critical role of demand profiles in shaping the optimal configurations and economics of supply chains and emphasize the need for diversified portfolios and co-optimization to facilitate sustainable energy transitions. 
Carbon sequestration is the process of capture and long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) with the aim to avoid dangerous climate change. In this paper, we propose a simple mathematical model (a coupled system of nonlinear ODEs) to capture some of the dynamical effects produced by adding charcoal to fertile soils. The main goal is to understand to which extent charcoal is able to lock up carbon in soils. Our results are preliminary in the sense that we do not solve the CO2 sequestration problem. Instead, we do set up a flexible modeling framework in which the interaction between charcoal and soil can be tackled by means of mathematical tools.   We show that our model is well-posed and has interesting large-time behaviour. Depending on the reference parameter range (e.g. type of soil) and chosen time scale, numerical simulations suggest that adding charcoal typically postpones the release of CO2. 
Global warming is seen as a drastic environmental problem nowadays. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration in the Earth's atmosphere is linked to the average temperature on the surface of the planet. Carbon capture and storage is an important technological endeavor aiming to improve the ecology. The present work investigates reaction paths that are responsible for CO 2 chemisorption by the ammonium- and phosphonium-based ionic liquids containing an aprotic heterocyclic anion 2-cyanopyrrolidine. We show that two moles of CO 2 per one mole of the gas scavenger can be theoretically fixed by such ionic liquids. Both the cation and anion participate in the chemisorption. The corresponding standard enthalpies are moderately negative. The barriers of all reactions involving the phosphonium-based cation are relatively small and favor practical applications of the considered sorbents. The performance of the ammonium-based cation is less favorable due to the inherent instability of the tetraalkylammonium ylide. The role is phosphonium ylide in the mechanism of the reaction is carefully characterized. The reported results foster a fundamental understanding of the outstanding CO 2 sorption performance of the quaternary ammonium and phosphonium-based 2-cyanopyrrolidines. 
Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle, impacting climate dynamics and necessitating accurate estimation for sustainable land and agricultural management. While traditional methods of SOC estimation face resolution and accuracy challenges, recent technological solutions harness remote sensing, machine learning, and high-resolution satellite mapping. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), especially when integrated with positional encoders, can capture complex relationships between soil and climate. Using the LUCAS database, this study compared four GNN operators in the positional encoder framework. Results revealed that the PESAGE and PETransformer models outperformed others in SOC estimation, indicating their potential in capturing the complex relationship between SOC and climate features. Our findings confirm the feasibility of applications of GNN architectures in SOC prediction, establishing a framework for future explorations of this topic with more advanced GNN models. 
This study examines stable carbon isotope (d13C) and concentration dynamics of DIC, DOC, and POC over an entire year, using a high resolution dataset. This research was performed in the catchment of the Schwabach River, a small, karstic headwater stream in Germany. The DIC data indicated the dominance of mineral weathering as a DIC source, with a dilution effect during high flow periods. A weakly negative relationship between discharge and d13CDIC indicates an increase in plant-derived organic matter during floods, transported to river waters via overland runoff and intermediate flow. DOC inputs were enhanced during periods of high discharge, indicating a greater importance of overland runoff as a DOC source. POC concentrations seem unaffected by discharge, but a slight negative correlation between d13CPOC and discharge may be derived from increased C4 plant material inputs. CO2 concentrations exceeded ambient atmospheric values throughout the year, confirming that the river surface waters are a net CO2 source. The total riverine carbon flux was dominated by DIC (70%), followed by CO2 efflux (21%), DOC (7%), and POC (2%). While a bi-monthly sampling scheme yielded a similar carbon flux estimate to that utilizing the entire dataset, the use of a monthly sampling interval differed by up to 19%. This discrepancy is due to the inability of a monthly sampling scheme to capture sudden and large variations in river discharge and associated dissolved/particulate carbon concentration changes, such as those observed during flooding. Bi-monthly sampling may be the minimum timeframe required for an acceptable degree of accuracy in carbon flux calculations. The application of high sampling frequencies and comprehensive DIC, DOC, and POC studies in future research would reduce uncertainties in riverine carbon budgets, and clarify the role of small streams in the global carbon cycle. 
The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the United States provides unprecedented incentives for deploying low-carbon hydrogen and liquid fuels, among other low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions technologies. To better understand the prospective competitiveness of low-carbon or negative-carbon hydrogen and liquid fuels under the IRA in the early 2030s, we examine the impacts of IRA provisions on costs of producing hydrogen and synthetic liquid fuel made from natural gas, electricity, short-cycle biomass (agricultural residues), and corn-ethanol. With IRA credits (45V or 45Q), but excluding incentives provided by other national or state policies, hydrogen produced by electrolysis using carbon-free electricity (green H2) and natural gas reforming with carbon capture and storage (CCS) (blue H2) are cost-competitive with the carbon-intensive benchmark gray H2 from steam methane reforming. Biomass-derived H2 with or without CCS is not cost-completive under current IRA provisions. However, if IRA allowed biomass gasification with CCS to claim a 45V credit for carbon-neutral H2 and a 45Q credit for negative biogenic-CO2 emissions, this pathway would be less costly than gray H2. The IRA credit for clean fuels (45Z), currently stipulated to end in 2027, would need to be extended, or similar policy support provided by other national or state policies, for clean synthetic liquid fuel to be cost-competitive with petroleum-derived liquid fuels. Levelized IRA subsidies per unit of CO2 mitigated for all hydrogen and synthetic liquid fuel production pathways, except electricity-derived synthetic liquid fuel, range from 65 to 384 $/t CO2, which is within or below the range in U.S. federal government estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) in the 2030 to 2040 timeframe. 
The CO2 capture efficiency in solvent-based carbon capture systems (CCSs) critically depends on the gas-solvent interfacial area (IA), making maximization of IA a foundational challenge in CCS design. While the IA associated with a particular CCS design can be estimated via a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, using CFD to derive the IAs associated with numerous CCS designs is prohibitively costly. Fortunately, previous works such as Deep Fluids (DF) (Kim et al., 2019) show that large simulation speedups are achievable by replacing CFD simulators with neural network (NN) surrogates that faithfully mimic the CFD simulation process. This raises the possibility of a fast, accurate replacement for a CFD simulator and therefore efficient approximation of the IAs required by CCS design optimization. Thus, here, we build on the DF approach to develop surrogates that can successfully be applied to our complex carbon-capture CFD simulations. Our optimized DF-style surrogates produce large speedups (4000x) while obtaining IA relative errors as low as 4% on unseen CCS configurations that lie within the range of training configurations. This hints at the promise of NN surrogates for our CCS design optimization problem. Nonetheless, DF has inherent limitations with respect to CCS design (e.g., limited transferability of trained models to new CCS packings). We conclude with ideas to address these challenges. 
Low-carbon dispatchable power underpins a sustainable energy system, providing load balancing complementing wide-scale deployment of intermittent renewable power. In this new context, fossil fuel-fired power plants must be coupled with a post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) process capable of highly transient operation. To tackle design and operational challenges simultaneously, we have developed a computational framework that integrates process design with techno-economic assessment. The backbone of this is a high-fidelity PCC mathematical model of a pressure-vacuum swing adsorption process. We demonstrate that the cost-optimal design has limited process flexibility, challenging reactiveness to disturbances, such as those in the flue gas feed conditions. The results illustrate that flexibility can be introduced by relaxing the CO$_2$ recovery constraint on the operation, albeit at the expense of the capture efficiency of the process. We discover that adsorption-based processes can accommodate for significant flexibility and improved performance with respect to the operational constraints on CO$_2$ recovery and purity. The results herein demonstrate a trade-off between process economics and process operability, which must be effectively rationalised to integrate CO$_2$ capture units in the design of low-carbon energy systems. 
A model for the description of proton collisions from molecules composed of atoms such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus (H, C, N, O, P) was recently extended to treat collisions with multiply charged ions with a focus on net ionization. Here we complement the work by focusing on net capture. The ion-atom collisions are computed using the two-center basis generator method. The atomic net capture cross sections are then used to assemble two models for ion-molecule collisions: an independent atom model (IAM) based on the Bragg additivity rule (labeled IAM-AR), and also the so-called pixel-counting method (IAM-PCM) which introduces dependence on the orientation of the molecule during impact. The IAM-PCM leads to significantly reduced capture cross sections relative to IAM-AR at low energies, since it takes into account the overlap of effective atomic cross sectional areas. We compare our results with available experimental and other theoretical data focusing on water vapor (H2O), methane (CH4) and uracil (C4H4N2O2). For the water molecule target we also provide results from a classical-trajectory Monte Carlo approach that includes dynamical screening effects on projectile and target. For small molecules dominated by a many-electron atom, such as carbon in methane, or oxygen in water we find a saturation phenomenon for higher projectile charges (Q = 3) and low energies, where the net capture cross section for the molecule is dominated by the net cross section for the many-electron atom, and the net capture cross section is not proportional to the total number of valence electrons. 
Imidazolium cations are promising for anion exchange membranes, and electrochemical applications and gas capture. They can be chemically modified in many ways including halogenation. Halogenation possibilities of the imidazole ring constitute a particular interest. This work investigates fluorination and chlorination reactions of all symmetrically non-equivalent sites of the imidazolium cation. Halogenation of all carbon atoms is thermodynamically permitted. Out of these, the most favorable site is the first methylene group of the alkyl chain. In turn, the least favorable site is carbon of the imidazole ring. Temperature dependence of enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy at 1 bar is discussed. The reported results provide an important guidance in functionalization of ionic liquids in search of task-specific compounds. 
A data driven computational model that accounts for more than two material states has been presented in this work. Presented model can account for multiple state variables, such as stresses, strains, strain rates and failure stress, as compared to previously reported models with two states. Model is used to perform deformation and failure simulations of carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube/epoxy nanocomposites. The model capability of capturing the strain rate dependent deformation and failure has been demonstrated through predictions against uniaxial test data taken from literature. The predicted results show a good agreement between data set taken from literature and simulations. 
Data from recent laser-shock experiments, density-functional theory (DFT) with molecular-dynamics (MD), and path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations on carbon are compared with predictions from the neutral-pseudo-atom (NPA)+ hyper-netted-chain (HNC) approach for carbon, a complex liquid in the warm-dense matter regime. The NPA results are in good agreement, not only with high-density regimes that have been studies via PIMC, but even at low densities and low temperatures where transient covalent bonding dominates ionic correlations. Thus the `pre-peak' due to the C-C bond at $\sim$1.4-1.6 \AA$\,$ and other features found in the pair-distribution function from DFT+MD simulations at 0.86 eV and 3.7 g/cm$^3$ etc., are recovered accurately in the NPA+HNC calculations. Such C-C bonding peaks have not been captured via average-atom ion-sphere (IS) models. Evidence for an unusual liquid $\to$ vapor and metal$\to$ semi-metal transition occurring simultaneously is presented. Here a strongly correlated metallic-liquid with transient C-C bonds, i.e., carbon at density $\sim$ 1.0 g/cm$^3$ and mean ionization $Z=4$ transits abruptly to a disordered mono-atomic vapour at 7 eV, with $Z\simeq$ 3. Other cases where $Z$ drops abruptly are also noted. The nature of $Z$, its discontinuities, and the role of exchange correlation, are reviewed. The limitations of IS models in capturing the physics of transient covalent bonding in warm dense matter are discussed. 
We present the results of a detailed spectroscopic study of the long period ($P=0.856$ days) RR Lyrae star, KP Cyg. We derived abundances of many chemical elements including the light species, iron-group elements and elements of the s-processes. Most RR Lyrae stars with periods longer than 0.7 days are metal-deficient objects. Surprisingly, our results show that KP Cyg is very metal rich ([Fe/H] $= +0.18\pm 0.23$). By comparison with a number of short period ($P=1\sim 6$ days), metal-rich CWB stars, we suggest that KP Cyg may be a very short period CWB star (BL Her star) rather than an RR Lyrae star. As seen in some CWB stars, KP Cyg shows strong excesses of carbon and nitrogen in its atmosphere. This indicates that the surface of KP Cyg has been polluted by material that has undergone helium burning (to enhance carbon) and proton capture (to transform carbon into nitrogen). We also note that UY CrB, whose period is 0.929 days, also shows an enhancement of C and N, and that two carbon cepheids of short period, V553 Cen and RT TrA, show similar excesses of carbon and nitrogen. 
We determine the liquid-solid phase diagram for carbon-oxygen and oxygen-selenium plasma mixtures using two-phase MD simulations. We identified liquid, solid, and interface regions using a bond angle metric. To study finite size effects, we perform 27648 and 55296 ion simulations. To help monitor non-equilibrium effects, we calculate diffusion constants $D_i$. For the carbon-oxygen system we find that $D_O$ for oxygen ions in the solid is much smaller than $D_C$ for carbon ions and that both diffusion constants are 80 or more times smaller than diffusion constants in the liquid phase. There is excellent agreement between our carbon-oxygen phase diagram and that predicted by Medin and Cumming. This suggests that errors from finite size and non-equilibrium effects are small and that the carbon-oxygen phase diagram is now accurately known. The oxygen-selenium system is a simple two-component model for more complex rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis ash compositions for an accreting neutron star. Diffusion of oxygen, in a predominately selenium crystal, is remarkably fast, comparable to diffusion in the liquid phase. We find a somewhat lower melting temperature for the oxygen-selenium system than that predicted by Medin and Cumming. This is probably because of electron screening effects. 
Segregation of impurities to grain boundaries plays an important role in both the stability and macroscopic behavior of polycrystalline materials. The research objective in this work is to better characterize the energetics and length scales involved with the process of solute and impurity segregation to grain boundaries. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to calculate the segregation energies for carbon within multiple grain boundary sites over a database of 125 symmetric tilt grain boundaries in Fe. The simulation results show that the majority of atomic sites near the grain boundary have segregation energies lower than in the bulk. Moreover, depending on the boundary, the segregation energies approach the bulk value approximately 5-12 \AA\ away from the center of the grain boundary, providing an energetic length scale for carbon segregation. A subsequent data reduction and statistical representation of this dataset provides critical information such as about the mean segregation energy and the associated energy distributions for carbon atoms as a function of distance from the grain boundary, which quantitatively informs higher scale models with energetics and length scales necessary for capturing the segregation behavior of impurities in Fe. The significance of this research is the development of a methodology capable of ascertaining segregation energies over a wide range of grain boundary character (typical of that observed in polycrystalline materials), which herein has been applied to carbon segregation in a specific class of grain boundaries in iron. 
The formation of collimated outflows or jets in planetary nebulae (PNe) is not well understood. There is no evidence for active accretion disks in PNe making it difficult to decide which of several proposed jet formation scenarios may be correct. A handful of wide binary central stars of PNe are known to have accreted carbon and slow neutron capture (s-process) enhanced material, the immediate progenitors of barium stars, however no close binary analogues are known to have passed through a common-envelope (CE) phase. Here we present spectroscopy of The Necklace taken near lightcurve minimum that for the first time reveals a carbon-rich (C/O > 1) companion, a carbon dwarf, in a post-CE central star. As unevolved stars do not produce carbon, the chemical enhancement of the secondary can only be explained by accretion from the primary. Accretion most likely happened prior to the CE phase via wind accretion as not enough material can be accreted during the short CE phase. The pair of jets in The Necklace, which are observed to be older than the PN, are therefore likely to have been launched from an accretion disk around the companion during this early accretion phase. This discovery adds significant weight to the emerging scenario that jets in post-CE PNe are primarily launched by an accretion disk around a main-sequence companion before the CE phase. 
C4 plants, such as maize, concentrate carbon dioxide in a specialized compartment surrounding the veins of their leaves to improve the efficiency of carbon dioxide assimilation. Nonlinear relationships between carbon dioxide and oxygen levels and reaction rates are key to their physiology but cannot be handled with standard techniques of constraint-based metabolic modeling. We demonstrate that incorporating these relationships as constraints on reaction rates and solving the resulting nonlinear optimization problem yields realistic predictions of the response of C4 systems to environmental and biochemical perturbations. Using a new genome-scale reconstruction of maize metabolism, we build an 18000-reaction, nonlinearly constrained model describing mesophyll and bundle sheath cells in 15 segments of the developing maize leaf, interacting via metabolite exchange, and use RNA-seq and enzyme activity measurements to predict spatial variation in metabolic state by a novel method that optimizes correlation between fluxes and expression data. Though such correlations are known to be weak in general, here the predicted fluxes achieve high correlation with the data, successfully capture the experimentally observed base-to-tip transition between carbon-importing tissue and carbon-exporting tissue, and include a nonzero growth rate, in contrast to prior results from similar methods in other systems. We suggest that developmental gradients may be particularly suited to the inference of metabolic fluxes from expression data. 
The fracture behavior of fiber-ceramics like C/C-SiC strongly depends on the initial damage arising during the production process. We study the transverse cracking of the 90{\deg} ply in [0/90]S cross-ply laminates due to the thermochemical degradation of the matrix material during the carbonization process by means of a discrete element method. The crack morphology strongly depends on the fiber-matrix interface properties, the transverse ply thickness as well as on the carbonization process itself. To model the 90{\deg} ply a two-dimensional triangular lattice of springs is constructed where nodes of the lattice represent fibers. Springs with random breaking thresholds model the disordered matrix material and interfaces. The spring-lattice is coupled by interface springs to two rigid bars which capture the two 0{\deg} plies or adjacent sublaminates in the model. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to follow the time evolution of the model system. It was found that under gradual heating of the specimen, after some distributed cracking, segmentation cracks occur in the 90{\deg} ply which then develop into a saturated state where the ply cannot support additional load. The dependence of the micro-structure of damage on the ply thickness and on the disorder in spring properties is also studied. Crack density and porosity of the system are monitored as a function of the temperature and compared to an analytic approach and experiments. 
Most of relatively warm, unevolved metal-poor stars ($T_{\rm eff}\gtrsim 5800\,\mathrm{K}$ and $[{\rm Fe/H}]\lesssim -1.5$) exhibit almost constant lithium abundances, irrespective of metallicity or effective temperature, and thus form the so-called Spite plateau. This was originally interpreted as arising from lithium created by the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Recent observations, however, have revealed that ultra metal-poor stars (UMP stars; $[\mathrm{Fe/H}]<-4.0$) have significantly lower lithium abundances than that of the plateau. Since most of the UMP stars are CEMP-no stars, carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with no excess of neutron-capture elements, a connection between the carbon enhancement and lithium depletion is suspected. A straightforward approach to this question is to investigate carbon-normal UMP stars. However only one object is known in this class. As an alternative, we have determined lithium abundances for two CEMP-no main-sequence turn-off stars with metallicities $[{\rm Fe/H}]\sim -3.0$, where there are numerous carbon-normal stars with available lithium abundances that can be considered. Our 1D LTE analysis indicates that the two CEMP-no stars have lithium abundances that are consistent with values near the plateau, which suggests that carbon enhancement and lithium depletion are not directly related. Instead, our results suggest that extremely low iron abundance is a fundamental cause to depleted lithium in UMP stars. 
Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) occurs when an O/Ne white dwarf (WD) grows to nearly the Chandrasekhar mass ($M_{\rm Ch}$), reaching central densities that trigger electron captures in the core. Using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics ($\texttt{MESA}$), we present the first true binary simulations of He star + O/Ne WD binaries, focusing on a $1.5 M_\odot$ He star in a 3 hour orbital period with $1.1-1.3 M_\odot$ O/Ne WDs. The helium star fills its Roche lobe after core helium burning is completed and donates helium on its thermal timescale to the WD, $\dot{M}\approx3\times10^{-6} M_\odot$/yr, a rate high enough that the accreting helium burns stably on the WD. The accumulated carbon/oxygen ashes from the helium burning undergo an unstable shell flash that initiates an inwardly moving carbon burning flame. This flame is only quenched when it runs out of carbon at the surface of the original O/Ne core. Subsequent accumulation of fresh carbon/oxygen layers also undergo thermal instabilities, but no mass loss is triggered, allowing $M_{\rm WD}\rightarrow M_{\rm Ch}$, triggering the onset of AIC. We also discuss the scenario of accreting C/O WDs that experience shell carbon ignitions to become O/Ne WDs, and then, under continuing mass transfer, lead to AIC. Studies of the AIC event rate using binary population synthesis should include all of these channels, especially this latter channel, which has been previously neglected but might dominate the rate. 
We report Mo isotopic data of 27 new presolar SiC grains, including 12 14N-rich AB (14N/15N>440, AB2) and 15 mainstream (MS) grains, and their correlated Sr and Ba isotope ratios when available. Direct comparison of the data for the MS grains, which came from low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with large s-process isotope enhancements, with the AB2 grain data demonstrates that AB2 grains show near-solar isotopic compositions and lack s-process enhancements. The near-normal Sr, Mo, and Ba isotopic compositions of AB2 grains clearly exclude born-again AGB stars, where the intermediate neutron-capture process (i-process) takes place, as their stellar source. On the other hand, low-mass CO novae, and early R- and J-type carbon stars show 13C and 14N excesses but no s-process enhancements and are thus potential stellar sources of AB2 grains. Since both early R-type carbon stars and CO novae are rare objects, the abundant J-type carbon stars (10-15% of all carbon stars) are thus likely to be a dominant source of AB2 grains. 
This research details outcomes from a global model which estimates future hydrogen penetration into a carbon constrained energy system to the year 2050. Focusing on minimum and maximum penetration scenarios, an investigation of global fuel cell vehicle (FCV) deployment is undertaken, cognizant of optimal economic deployment at the global level and stakeholder preferences in a case study of Japan. The model is mathematically formulated as a very large-scale linear optimization problem, aiming to minimize system costs, including generation type, fuel costs, conversion costs, and carbon reduction costs, subject to the constraint of carbon dioxide reductions for each nation. Results show that between approximately 0.8% and 2% of global energy consumption needs can be met by hydrogen out to the year 2050, with city gas and transport emerging as significant use cases. Passenger FCVs and hydrogen buses account for almost all of the hydrogen-based transportation sector, leading to a global deployment of approximately 120 million FCVs by 2050. Hydrogen production is reliant on fossil fuels, and OECD nations are net importers - especially Japan with a 100% import case. To underpin hydrogen production from fossil fuels, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is required in significant quantities when anticipating a large fleet of FCVs. Stakeholder engagement suggests optimism toward FCV deployment while policy issues identified include necessity for large-scale future energy system investment and rapid technical and economic feasibility progress for renewable energy technologies and electrolyzers. 
In the present work, we report the dynamics and geometrical features of the plasma plume formed by the laser ablation of copper and graphite (carbon) targets in the presence of different transverse magnetic field. This work emphasizes on the effect of atomic mass of the plume species on the diamagnetic behaviour and geometrical aspect of the expanding plasma plume in the magnetic field. The time-resolved analysis of the simultaneously captured two directional images in orthogonal to the expansion axis is carried out for the comparative study of projected three-dimensional structure of copper and carbon plasma plume. In the presence of magnetic field, sharp differences are observed between the copper and carbon plasma plumes in terms of formation of diamagnetic cavity and structure formation. An elliptical cavity-like structure is observed in case of copper plasma plume which attains the sharp conical shape with increasing the time delay or magnetic field strength. On the other hand, splitted carbon plasma plume appears as a Y-shape structure in the presence of magnetic field where the cavity-like structure is not observed for the considered time and magnetic field. Based on the modified energy balance relation for the elliptic cylindrical geometry, we have also simulated the dynamics of the plume which is in close agreement with observed plasma expansion in diamagnetic and non-diamagnetic regions. 
1.5 billion smartphones are sold annually, and most are decommissioned less than two years later. Most of these unwanted smartphones are neither discarded nor recycled but languish in junk drawers and storage units. This computational stockpile represents a substantial wasted potential: modern smartphones have increasingly high-performance and energy-efficient processors, extensive networking capabilities, and a reliable built-in power supply. This project studies the ability to reuse smartphones as "junkyard computers." Junkyard computers grow global computing capacity by extending device lifetimes, which supplants the manufacture of new devices. We show that the capabilities of even decade-old smartphones are within those demanded by modern cloud microservices and discuss how to combine phones to perform increasingly complex tasks. We describe how current operation-focused metrics do not capture the actual carbon costs of compute. We propose Computational Carbon Intensity -- a performance metric that balances the continued service of older devices with the superlinear runtime improvements of newer machines. We use this metric to redefine device service lifetime in terms of carbon efficiency. We develop a cloudlet of reused Pixel 3A phones. We analyze the carbon benefits of deploying large, end-to-end microservice-based applications on these smartphones. Finally, we describe system architectures and associated challenges to scale to cloudlets with hundreds and thousands of smartphones. 
Industrial sectors such as urban centers, chemical companies, manufacturing facilities, and microgrids are actively exploring strategies to help reduce their carbon footprint. For instance, university campuses are complex urban districts (involving collections of buildings and utility systems) that are seeking to reduce carbon footprints that originate from diverse activities (e.g., transportation operations and production of heating, cooling, and power utilities). This work presents an optimization framework to identify technology pathways that enable decarbonization of complex industrial sectors. The framework uses a graph abstraction that compactly captures interdependencies between diverse products and technologies as well as diverse externalities (e.g., market, policy, and carbon prices). Duality analysis reveals that the formulation can be interpreted as an economy, market, or value chain that uses technologies to generate economic value (wealth) by transforming basic products into higher value products. This interpretation also reveals that the formulation identifies pathways that maximize the profit of stakeholders, helps reveal the inherent value (prices) of intermediate products, and helps analyze the impact of externalities and technology specifications on product values. Our developments are illustrated via a case study involving a prototypical university campus that seeks to identify pathways that reduce its carbon footprint (e.g., via electrification and deployment of hydrogen technologies). We use the framework to determine carbon tax values, technology specifications, and investment budgets that activate different technology pathways and that achieve different levels of decarbonization. 
Sorbent materials are a promising alternative to advance hydrogen storage technologies. The general disadvantage is the relatively weak solid-gas interaction and adsorption energy, providing low gravimetric and volumetric capacities and extreme operational conditions. Here we propose Au-doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as an efficient alternative for reversible hydrogen capture at high temperatures. This work investigates the properties of several modified CNTs using density functional theory. We analyze the binding and formation energies of the uniformed Au-doped CNTs and assess their adsorption capability. The hydrogen storage mechanisms of the nanostructures are studied in depth using partial density of states and charge transfer analysis showing that the increase of diameter has a positive effect on the outcome. Our findings show that the modified structures are able to capture from six to nine hydrogen molecules per gold atom, achieving volumetric capacities ranging from 154 to 330 g/l, surpassing the DOE target. In addition, the calculated desorption temperatures indicate high performance of Au-doped CNTs, obtaining hydrogen capture-release working conditions above 200 K. 
Direct air capture of Carbon Dioxide is a technical solution that does not rely on natural processes to capture CO2 from the atmosphere. In DAC, the filter material is designed to specifically bind CO2 molecules. Hence a high-capacity filter is sought. We aim to leverage the potential of quantum computing to improve the filters used in DAC. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have high surface area and tunable pore sizes which makes them an attractive material for gas storage and separation. Using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, we find the minimum of the potential energy surface (PES) by first considering only the active site of the MOF (the metal ion). For complex systems, we employ Density Matrix Embedding Theory and use VQE as a fragment solver at the binding site. Techniques like deparameterisation are used to minimise the count of trainable parameters. We present results of ideal and noisy simulations as well as from a real hardware device. Resources are estimated for MOFs unit cell. The findings from our study demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to effectively perform quantum simulations of strongly correlated fragments. 
We present an elemental abundance analysis for four newly discovered ultra metal-poor stars from the Hamburg/ESO survey, with $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\leq-4$. Based on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra, we derive abundances for 17 elements in the range from Li to Ba. Three of the four stars exhibit moderate to large over-abundances of carbon, but have no enhancements in their neutron-capture elements. The most metal-poor star in the sample, HE~0233$-$0343 ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]} = -4.68$), is a subgiant with a carbon enhancement of $\mathrm{[C/Fe]}= +3.5$, slightly above the carbon-enhancement plateau suggested by Spite et al. No carbon is detected in the spectrum of the fourth star, but the quality of its spectrum only allows for the determination of an upper limit on the carbon abundance ratio of $\mathrm{[C/Fe]} < +1.7$. We detect lithium in the spectra of two of the carbon-enhanced stars, including HE~0233$-$0343. Both stars with Li detections are Li-depleted, with respect to the Li plateau for metal-poor dwarfs found by Spite \& Spite. This suggests that whatever site(s) produced C either do not completely destroy lithium, or that Li has been astrated by early-generation stars and mixed with primordial Li in the gas that formed the stars observed at present. The derived abundances for the $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements of the four stars are similar to those found in previous large samples of extremely and ultra metal-poor stars. Finally, a large spread is found in the abundances of Sr and Ba for these stars, possibly influenced by enrichment from fast rotating stars in the early universe. 
The detailed composition of most metal-poor halo stars has been found to be very uniform. However, a fraction of 20-70% (increasing with decreasing metallicity) exhibit dramatic enhancements in their abundances of carbon - the so-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. A key question for Galactic chemical evolution models is whether this non-standard composition reflects that of the stellar natal clouds, or is due to local, post-birth mass transfer of chemically processed material from a binary companion; CEMP stars should then all be members of binary systems. Our aim is to determine the frequency and orbital parameters of binaries among CEMP stars with and without over-abundances of neutron-capture elements - CEMP-s and CEMP-no stars, respectively - as a test of this local mass-transfer scenario. This paper discusses a sample of 24 CEMP-no stars, while a subsequent paper will consider a similar sample of CEMP-s stars. Most programme stars exhibit no statistically significant radial-velocit variation over this period and appear to be single, while four are found to be binaries with orbital periods of 300-2,000 days and normal eccentricity; the binary frequency for the sample is 17+-9%. The single stars mostly belong to the recently-identified ``low-C band'', while the binaries have higher absolute carbon abundances. We conclude that the nucleosynthetic process responsible for the strong carbon excess in these ancient stars is unrelated to their binary status; the carbon was imprinted on their natal molecular clouds in the early Galactic ISM by an even earlier, external source, strongly indicating that the CEMP-no stars are likely bona fide second-generation stars. We discuss potential production sites for carbon and its transfer across interstellar distances in the early ISM, and implications for the composition of high-redshift DLA systems. Abridged. 
A mathematical model of the process of carbon capture in a packed column by adsorption is developed and analysed. First a detailed study is made of the governing equations. Due to the complexity of the internal geometry it is standard practice to average these equations. Here the averaging process is revisited. This shows that there exists a number of errors and some confusion in the standard systems studied in the literature. These errors affect the parameter estimation, with consequences when the experimental set-up is modified or scaled-up. Assuming, as a first approximation, an isothermal model the gas concentration equation is solved numerically. Excellent agreement with data from a pressure swing adsorption experiment is demonstrated. A new analytical solution (valid away from the inlet) is obtained. This provides explicit relations for quantities such as the amount of adsorbed gas, time of first breakthrough, total process time and width and speed of the reaction zone, showing how these depend on the operating conditions and material parameters. The relations show clearly how to optimise the carbon capture process. By comparison with experimental data the analytical solution may also be used to calculate unknown system parameters. 
Computational screening methods have been accelerating discovery of new materials and deployment of technologies based on them in many areas from batteries and alloys to photovoltaics and separation processes. In this review, we focus on post-combustion carbon capture using adsorption in porous materials. Prompted by unprecedented developments in material science, researchers in material engineering, molecular simulations, and process modelling have been interested in finding the best materials for carbon capture using energy efficient pressure-swing adsorption processes. Recent efforts have been directed towards development of new multiscale and performance-based screening workflows where we are able to go from the atomistic structure of an adsorbent to its equilibrium and transport properties for gas adsorption, and eventually to its separation performance in the actual process. The objective of this article is to review the current status of these emerging approaches, explain their significance for materials screening, while at the same time highlighting the existing pitfalls and challenges that limit their application in practice and industry. It is also the intention of this review to encourage cross-disciplinary collaborations for the development of more advanced screening methodologies. For this specific reason, we undertake an additional task of compiling and introducing all the elements that are needed for the development and operation of the performance-based screening workflows, including information about available materials databases, state-of-the-art molecular simulation and process modelling tools and methods, and the full list of data and parameters required for each stage. 
Team C2CNT, or team Carbon dioxide to carbon nanotubes, proprietary technology directly removes the widest range of carbon dioxide from the ecosystem. C2CNT technology simply transforms low to high carbon dioxide into carbon and oxygen, and the carbon produced is permanently removed, that is stable on the order of geologic time frames. C2CNT technology directly removes, transforms and stores atmospheric 0.04% CO2 without pre-concentration from the air, or 5% CO2 removal of gas power plant CO2 emissions, or 12.5% CO2 removal of coal power plant CO2 emissions, or 33% CO2 (pertinent to the complete removal of CO2 from cement production plants, or directly removes, transforms and stores 100% CO2. 
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) moves atmospheric carbon to geological or land-based sinks. In a first-best setting, the optimal use of CDR is achieved by a removal subsidy that equals the optimal carbon tax and marginal damages. We derive second-best policy rules for CDR subsidies and carbon taxes when no global carbon price exists but a national government implements a unilateral climate policy. We find that the optimal carbon tax differs from an optimal CDR subsidy because of carbon leakage and a balance of resource trade effect. First, the optimal removal subsidy tends to be larger than the carbon tax because of lower supply-side leakage on fossil resource markets. Second, net carbon exporters exacerbate this wedge to increase producer surplus of their carbon resource producers, implying even larger removal subsidies. Third, net carbon importers may set their removal subsidy even below their carbon tax when marginal environmental damages are small, to appropriate producer surplus from carbon exporters. 
The Earth is strongly depleted in carbon compared to the dust in the ISM, implying efficient removal of refractory carbon before parent body formation. It has been argued that grains get rid of their carbon through oxidation and photolysis in the exposed upper disk layers. We assess the efficacy of these C-removal mechanisms accounting for the vertical and radial transport of grains. We obtain the carbon and carbon free mass budget of solids by solving two 1D advection-diffusion equations, accounting for the dust grain size distribution and radial transport. The carbon removal acts on the fraction of the grains that are in the exposed layer and requires efficient vertical transport. In models without radial transport, oxidation and photolysis can destroy most of the refractory carbon in terrestrial planet formation region. But it only reaches the observed depletion levels for extreme parameter combinations and requires that parent body formation was delayed by 1 Myr. Adding radial transport of solids prevents the depletion entirely, leaving refractory carbon equally distributed throughout the disk. It is unlikely that the observed carbon depletion can ultimately be attributed to mechanisms operating on small grains in the disk surface layers. Other mechanisms need to be studied, for example flash heating events or FU Ori outbursts in order to remove carbon quickly and deeply. However, a sustained drift barrier or strongly reduced radial grain mobility are necessary to prevent replenishment of carbon from the outer disk. 
While low-cost natural gas remains abundant, the energy content of this fuel can be utilized without greenhouse gas emissions through the production of molecular hydrogen and solid carbon via methane pyrolysis. In the absence of a carbon tax, methane pyrolysis is not economically competitive with current hydrogen production methods unless the carbon byproducts can be valorized. In this work, we assess the viability of the carbon byproduct produced from methane pyrolysis in molten salts as high-value-added anode or conductive additive for secondary Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Raman characterization and electrochemical differential capacity analysis demonstrate that the use of molten salt mixtures with catalytically-active FeCl3- or MnCl2 result in more graphitic carbon co-products. These graphitic carbons exhibit the best electrochemical performance (up to 272 mAh/g of reversible capacity) when used as Li-ion anodes. For all carbon samples studied here, disordered carbon domains and retained salt species trapped and/or intercalated into the carbon structure were identified by X-ray photoelectron and multinuclear solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The latter lead to reduced electrochemical activity and reversibility, and poorer rate performance compared to commercial carbon anodes. The electronic conductivity of the pyrolyzed carbons is found to be highly dependent on their purity, with the purest carbon exhibiting an electronic conductivity nearly on par with that of commercial carbon additives. These findings suggest that more effective removal of the salt catalyst could enable applications of these carbons in secondary batteries, providing a financial incentive for the large-scale implementation of methane pyrolysis for low-carbon hydrogen production. 
Cleaning of contamination of optical surfaces by amorphous carbon (a-C) is highly relevant for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. We have studied the mechanisms for a-C removal from a Si surface. By comparing a-C removal in a surface wave discharge (SWD) plasma and an EUV-induced plasma, the cleaning mechanisms for hydrogen and helium gas environments were determined. The C-atom removal per incident ion was estimated for different sample bias voltages and ion fluxes. It was found that H2 plasmas generally had higher cleaning rates than He plasmas: up to seven times higher for more negatively biased samples in EUV induced plasma. Moreover, for H2, EUV induced plasma was found to be 2-3 times more efficient at removing carbon than the SWD plasma. It was observed carbon removal during exposure to He is due to physical sputtering by He+ ions. In H2, on the other hand, the increase in carbon removal rates is due to chemical sputtering. This is a new C cleaning mechanism for EUV-induced plasma, which we call "EUV-reactive ion sputtering". 
Carbon dioxide will likely need to be removed from the atmosphere to avoid significant future warming and climate change. Technologies are being developed to remove large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere. Enhanced rock weathering (ERW), where fine-grained silicate minerals are spread on soil, is a promising carbon removal method that can also support crop yields and maintain overall soil health. Quantifying the amount of carbon removed by ERW is crucial for understanding the potential of ERW globally and for building trust in commercial operations. However, reliable and scalable quantification in complex media like soil is challenging and there is not yet a consensus on the best method of doing so. Here we discuss mass-balance methods, where stocks of base cations in soil are monitored over time to infer the amount of inorganic carbon brought into solution by weathering reactions. First, we review the fundamental concepts of mass-balance methods and explain different ways of approaching the mass-balance problem. Then we discuss experimental planning and data collection, suggesting some best practices. Next, we present a software package designed to facilitate a range of tasks in ERW like uncertainty analysis, planning field trials, and validating statistical methods. Finally, we briefly review ways of estimating carbon removal using mass balance before discussing some advantages of Bayesian inference in this context and presenting an example Bayesian model. The model is fit to simulated data and recovers the correct answer with a clear representation of uncertainty. 
Transformation of carbon dioxide into carbon nanotubes, CNTs, by electrolysis in molten carbonates provides a low cost route to extract and store this greenhouse gas. CNTs are more stable, compact and valuable than fuels or other CO2 conversion products, providing an incentive to remove CO2 for climate mitigation. Previously, solid core carbon nanofibers, CNFs were formed with C-13 isotope CO2, whereas hollow core fibers - carbon nanotubes, CNTs, were formed with natural isotope CO2 splitting in molten lithium carbonate. Here we demonstrate the extraordinary range of specific morphologies and conductivities of CNTs that can be achieved through control of the electrolysis conditions in a one pot-synthesis, and scale-up of this process by which the greenhouse gas CO2 is transformed into carbon nanotubes by molten carbonate electrolysis. Addition of Li2BO3, boron dopes and greatly enhances CNT conductivity formed at the galvanized steel cathode. Addition of CaCO3 to the Li2CO3 electrolyte, decreases oxide solubility in the region of CNT growth, producing straight thin-walled CNTs. 
We found that carbon-associated byproducts formed at the dry-oxidized SiO2/SiC(0001) interface could be decomposed and be taken out to the SiO2 side by high-purity Ar annealing. We evaluated the concentration of the ejected carbon atoms in the SiO2 by secondary ion mass spectrometry, and discovered that it clearly depends on the condition of oxide formation (dry-oxidation, nitridation treatment, and phosphorus treatment). This work provides an indirect but unambiguous evidence for the carbon-byproducts existing at the SiO2/SiC interfaces, and also indicates that the phosphorus treatment removes the carbon-byproducts, leading to significant reduction of interface defects. 
A comparative study between zinc oxide graphene-carbon nanotubes nanocomposite and ZnO nanoparticles was carried out to investigate their abilities in the degradation of Rhodamine B dye. We utilized the Modified Hummer method to prepare the graphene oxide nanosheet. Moreover, graphene-carbon nanotubes had been synthesized from GO and multi-walled carbon nanotubes with a hydroxyl group. The hydrothermal method was employed to fabricate the zinc oxide graphene-carbon nanotubes nanocomposite from ZnO nanoparticles and graphene-carbon nanotubes. During the characterization by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), all the significant peaks of ZnO and zinc oxide graphene-carbon nanotubes nanocomposite were found in the same phase angle. In addition, the final nanocomposite was also characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). Finally, from the dye degradation test, it was apparent that zinc oxide graphene-carbon nanotubes nanocomposite showed superior dye removal ability compared to the ZnO nanoparticles. 
The increasing level of atmospheric carbon dioxide has driven public discourse throughout the world. An immediate implementation of carbon-free energy sources is demanded with little discussion of costs, technical constraints on the sources, or implications of high residual levels of carbon dioxide. Residual carbon-dioxide can be removed from the air, but the cost to remove the carbon-dioxide produced by human activity during a year is thought to be trillions of dollars---otherwise it remains in the atmosphere for centuries. Economic considerations may limit wind and solar sources to less than 40\% of the electricity production. Fission or fusion may be the only choice for most of the rest. Development costs are orders of magnitude smaller than implementation costs, which are tens of trillions of dollars for fission. A needless delay in the development of fusion has enormous financial implications. As will be shown stellarators are better positioned than any other concept for a fast path to fusion. A computationally derived conceptual design for a stellarator reactor may allow final design and construction to be initiated without the delay of intermediate generations of experiments. The most urgent issue is the development of conceptual designs. 
In the synthesis of highly crystalline single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), high growth temperatures are preferred, while the formation of impurity amorphous carbon (a-C) causes the termination of SWCNT growth and degrades its properties. To remove this by-product, H2O and CO2 have been employed in metal-catalyzed SWCNT growth systems because of their oxidizing ability. Recently, nonmetallic nanoparticles have become one of the growth seed candidates because of their high melting points and fewer metal impurities. In this study, by using nanodiamond-derived carbon nanoparticles as the solid growth seeds, we investigated the effect of CO2 and H2O on high-temperature SWCNT growth with two types of carbon-source supplies: C2H2 and C2H4. In this growth system, H2O showed oxidizing ability to etch a-C with either carbon sources. CO2 exhibited a similar a-C formation-preventing role in C2H4-supplied growth and achieved higher-purity SWCNTs with higher concentration of C2H4 than the case of H2O. However, in contrast to the other combinations, CO2 injection in the C2H2-supplied growth significantly enhanced the formation of a-C rather than the removal of it while the yield of SWCNTs was also increased, indicating the occurrence of the dehydration reaction between CO2 and C2H2. The present findings will lead to efficient growth of high-quality SWCNTs from nonmetallic growth seeds with the use of growth enhancers. 
This study introduces the high yield, electrolytic synthesis of carbon nanofibers, CNFs, directly from carbon dioxide. Production of a precious commodity such as CNFs from atmospheric carbon dioxide provides impetus to limit this greenhouse gas and mitigate the rate of climate change. CNFs are formed at high rate using inexpensive nickel and steel electrodes in molten electrolytes. The process is demonstrated as a scaled-up stand-alone electrolytic cell, and is also shown compatible with the STEP, solar thermal electrochemical process, using concentrated sunlight at high solar to electric efficiency to provide the heat and electrical energy to drive the CNF production. In the supplement section modes of both natural gas and coal power plant operation are presented which remove the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from the exhaust and transform it into a carbon nanofiber product. 
A climate mitigation comprehensive solution is presented through the first high yield, low energy synthesis of macroscopic length carbon nanotubes (CNT) wool from CO2 by molten carbonate electrolysis, suitable for weaving into carbon composites and textiles. Growing CO2 concentrations, the concurrent climate change and species extinction can be addressed if CO2 becomes a sought resource rather than a greenhouse pollutant. Inexpensive carbon composites formed from carbon wool as a lighter metal, textiles and cement replacement comprise a major market sink to compactly store transformed anthropogenic CO2. 100x-longer CNTs grow on Monel versus steel. Monel, electrolyte equilibration, and a mixed metal nucleation facilitate the synthesis. CO2, the sole reactant in this transformation, is directly extractable from dilute (atmospheric) or concentrated sources, and is cost constrained only by the (low) cost of electricity. Today's $100K per ton CNT valuation incentivizes CO2 removal. 
This study describes computer simulations of carbonization and graphite formation, including the effects of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. We introduce a novel technique to simulate carbonization, "Simulation of Thermal Emission of Atoms and Molecules (STEAM)," designed to elucidate the removal of volatiles and density variations in carbonization residue. The investigation extensively analyzes the functional groups that endure through high-temperature carbonization and examines the graphitization processes in carbon-rich materials containing non-carbon "impurity elements". The physical, vibrational, and electronic attributes of impure amorphous graphite are analyzed, and the impact of nitrogen on electronic conduction is investigated, revealing its substitutional integration into the sp$^2$ layered network. 
Due to the hydrolytic instability of $LiPF_6$ in carbonate-based solvents, HF is a typical impurity in Li-ion battery electrolytes. HF significantly influences the performance of Li-ion batteries, for example by impacting the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase at the anode and by affecting transition metal dissolution at the cathode. Additionally, HF complicates studying fundamental interfacial electrochemistry of Li-ion battery electrolytes, such as direct anion reduction, because it is electrocatalytically relatively unstable, resulting in LiF passivation layers. Methods to selectively remove ppm levels of HF from $LiPF_6$-containing carbonate-based electrolytes are limited. We introduce and benchmark a simple yet efficient electrochemical in situ method to selectively remove ppm amounts of HF from $LiPF_6$-containing carbonate-based electrolytes. The basic idea is the application of a suitable potential to a high surface-area metallic electrode upon which only HF reacts (electrocatalytically) while all other electrolyte components are unaffected under the respective conditions. 
Surface modification is an important topic to improve dental implants. Corundum residues, which are part of current dental implant blasting, disappeared on Straumann dental implants in recent publications. In our investigations of the surface of 4 different Straumann implants using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) we found the following three main findings: surfaces are nearly corundum-free, disseminated gap-framed corundum particles and significant molecular carbon residues. The data strongly suggest that Straumann applies a modified surface technology on dental implants to remove corundum residues and involving unclear carbons. One explanation could be, a Straumann patent involving a dextran coating allowing easy corundum particle removal by aqueous solution, while unintended molecular carbon residues cannot explain all findings. This change of the production process without a new approval by the FDA would be a violation of US federal law and the carbon bindings are a possible danger to patients. 
The eikonal direct-reaction model, as used in spectroscopic studies of intermediate-energy nucleon-removal reactions on light target nuclei, is considered in the case of a proton target and applied to neutron removal from $^{29}$Ne at 240 MeV/nucleon. The computed cross sections and their sensitivities are compared using an earlier detailed analysis of carbon target data. The nuclear structure input, for the $^{29}$Ne ground-state and $^{28}$Ne final states, is that deduced from the carbon target analysis. The comparisons quantify the sensitivity of the two reactions to the angular momenta and binding energies of the active valence orbitals - showing the carbon target to be relatively more efficient for removals from weakly-bound, low-$\ell$, halo-like orbitals. Probing this sensitivity experimentally would provide useful tests of these predictions and of the model's description of the reaction mechanism. 
In this paper, we report herein, the conversion of waste prescription and non-prescription pharmaceuticals into carbonaceous materials. The hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of the pharmaceuticals was carried out at temperatures of 180, 230 and 275 0C in closed reactors for 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively. The main products from the carbonization process were in the solids, liquids and gas phases. The resulting hydrochars were shown to be very functionalized with a high degree of aromaticity and high carbon content (between 55% to 65%). The adsorptive capacity of the hydrochars to remove Pb2+ ions from an aqueous system was evaluated and compared to that of analytical reagent activated carbon (AR-AC) through batch adsorptive tests. The effect of contact time on batch adsorption experiments with an initial Pb2+ concentration of 50 mg/L was also evaluated. The results indicated that PH24_230 has a better adsorption capacity when compared to AR-AC; achieving over 97% removal of Pb2+ after 60 minutes. The batch adsorption studies were best described by the pseudo-second order kinetic model with coefficient of regression (R2) values above 0.99. Also, slow pyrolysis experiments were carried out to evaluate the difference in solid yields, char heating value and surface area. Pyrochar yields were slightly higher, while heating values were one order of magnitude lower when compared to hydrochars. The pyrolysis conducted at 700{\deg}C led to the pyrochar with the highest value of the surface area (63.15 m2/g). The study shows that valuable products can be generated successfully from the hydrothermal carbonization of waste pharmaceuticals.   KEYWORDS: waste pharmaceuticals; hydrothermal carbonization; hydrochars, batch adsorption, adsorption capacity 
Iron oxide-based nanostructures receive significant attention as an efficient adsorbent for organic dyes removal. The removal properties have strong dependency on the stoichiometry, phases, reactive edges, defect states etc present in the iron-oxides nanostructures. Herein, iron oxide/carbon composite with well-defined heterophased grain boundaries is synthesized by simple precipitation method and followed by calcination. The local structure, spin dynamics and magnetic properties of heterophased iron oxides/carbon composite are thoroughly investigated to explore its cationic and anionic dye removal capability. To validate the effectivity of the presence of heterogeneous grain boundaries, iron oxide/carbon nanocomposite with homogeneous grain boundaries is also examined. It was found that the hetero-phased iron oxide/carbon showed removal capacity of 35.45 mg g-1 and 45.84 mg g-1 for cationic (Crystal Violet) and anionic (Congo Red) dyes, respectively as compared to that of as-synthesised imidazole-capped superparamagnetic {\alpha}-Fe2O3 (25.11 mg g-1 and 40.44 mg g-1, respectively) and homophased iron oxide/carbon nanocomposite (9.41 mg g-1 and 5.43 mg g-1, respectively). The plausible mechanism on the local structural evolution of the heterophase in the course of calcination and increase of the removal capacity is discussed. A detailed dye adsorption investigation is presented including the adsorption kinetic study. The pseudo-second order kinetic model is found to be an appropriate one and suggests that the chemisorption is dominant factor leading to adsorption of dyes. Whereas Weber-Morris model indicate the strong influence of boundary layers of nanocomposite on the adsorption process. 
The transition towards carbon-neutral electricity is one of the biggest game changers in addressing climate change since it addresses the dual challenges of removing carbon emissions from the two largest sectors of emitters: electricity and transportation. The transition to a carbon-neutral electric grid poses significant challenges to conventional paradigms of modern grid planning and operation. Much of the challenge arises from the scale of the decision making and the uncertainty associated with the energy supply and demand. Artificial Intelligence (AI) could potentially have a transformative impact on accelerating the speed and scale of carbon-neutral transition, as many decision making processes in the power grid can be cast as classic, though challenging, machine learning tasks. We point out that to amplify AI's impact on carbon-neutral transition of the electric energy systems, the AI algorithms originally developed for other applications should be tailored in three layers of technology, markets, and policy. 
This implementation guidance focuses on carbon removal and sequestration via wood harvesting and storage (WHS), a process where woody biomass, with the embedded carbon, is stored for long timescales in shallow geologic storage. The engineering structure designed to ensure such durable storage by preventing biomass decomposition is called a Wood Vault.   This guidance contains the requirements for a basic Wood Vault project, and is intended to aid project developers, verifiers, and registries in this space. It describes a set of requirements that govern the end-to-end process of carbon removal and sequestration. This includes carbon accounting, wood sourcing via wood residual (WR) utilization, Wood Vault construction and maintenance, as well as processes for monitoring, verification, and credit issuance. Carbon accounting requirements include baseline, or counterfactual specification, and full life cycle analysis (LCA) within a specified process boundary. For the vault itself, the guidance describes a buried vault with the burial chamber covered by a layer of low permeability material to create anoxic condition. Other types of vaults can also be used to adjust to local environmental, transport, and economic constraints. Monitoring and verification requirements include in-situ sensors, gas sampling, sample excavations, and site maintenance. This guidance also contemplates land ownership and legal assurances, as well as environmental and societal impact assessments.   The implementation guidance concludes with recommendations regarding auditing, certification and carbon credit issuance. 
In this radiation tolerance study, Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) with a carbon-enriched broad and shallow multiplication layer were examined in comparison to identical non-carbonated LGADs. Manufactured at IMB-CNM, the sensors underwent neutron irradiation at the TRIGA reactor in Ljubljana, reaching a fluence of $1.5e^{15} {n_{eq}} cm^{-2}$. The results revealed a smaller deactivation of boron and improved resistance to radiation in carbonated LGADs. The study demonstrated the potential benefits of carbon enrichment in mitigating radiation damage effects, particularly the acceptor removal mechanism, reducing the acceptor removal constant by more than a factor of two. Additionally, time resolution and collected charge degradation due to irradiation were observed, with carbonated samples exhibiting better radiation tolerance. A noise analysis focused on baseline noise and spurious pulses showed the presence of thermal-generated dark counts attributed to a too narrow distance between the gain layer end and the p-stop implant at the periphery of the pad for the characterized LGAD design; however, without significant impact of operation performance. 
Radon and radon daughters pose significant backgrounds to rare-event searching experiments. Activated carbon, which has very strong adsorption capacity for radon, can be used for radon removal and radon enrichment. The internal $^{226}$Ra concentration ultimately limits its radon enrichment ability. In order to measure the intrinsic background and study the radon adsorption capability of Saratech activated carbon at various temperatures, a radon-emanation measurement system with a high-sensitivity radon detector and an adsorption-performance research-system have been developed. In this paper, a 0.71~mBq/m$^3$ high-sensitivity radon detector and measurement details of the radon-adsorption capability of Saratech activated carbon at low temperature will be presented. 
The conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is optimized by modifying the optical design and improving absorbance within the cell. These objectives are obtained by creating different sized cavities in TiO2 photoanode. For this purpose, carbon nanospheres with diameters 100-600 nm are synthesized by hydrothermal method. A paste of TiO2 is mixed with various amounts of carbon nanospheres. During TiO2 photoanode sintering processes at 500C temperature, the carbon nanospheres are removed. This leads to random creation of cavities in the DSSCs photoanode. These cavities enhance light scattering and porosity which improve light absorbance by dye N719 and provide a larger surface area for dye loading. These consequences enhance performance of DSSCs. By mixing 3% Wt. carbon nanospheres in the TiO2 pastes, we were able to increase the short circuit current density and efficiency by 40% (from 12.59 to 17.73 mA/cm2) and 33% (from 5.72% to 7.59%), respectively. 
Removing a single-carbon vacancy introduces (quasi-)localized states for both and electrons in graphene. Interactions between the localized dangling bond and quasilocalized electrons of a single-carbon vacancy in graphene are predicted to control its magnetism. However, experimentally confirming this prediction through manipulating the interactions between the and electrons remains an outstanding challenge. Here we report the manipulation of magnetism of individual single-carbon vacancy in graphene by using a scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) tip. Our spin-polarized STM measurements, complemented by density functional theory calculations, indicate that interactions between the localized and quasilocalized electrons could split the electrons into two states with opposite spins even when they are well above the Fermi level. Via the STM tip, we successfully manipulate both the magnitude and direction of magnetic moment of the electrons with respect to that of the electrons. Three different magnetic states of the single-carbon vacancy, exhibiting magnetic moments of about 1.6, 0.5, and 0 respectively, are realized in our experiment. 
A high fraction of carbon bound in solid carbonaceous material is observed to exist in bodies formed in the cold outskirts of the solar nebula, while bodies in the terrestrial planets region contain nearly none. We study the fate of the carbonaceous material during the spiral-in of matter as the sun accretes matter from the solar nebula. From observational data on the composition of the dust component in comets and interplanetary dust particles, and from data on pyrolysis experiments, we construct a model for the composition of the pristine carbonaceous material in the outer parts of the solar nebula. We study the pyrolysis of the refractory and volatile organic component and the concomitant release of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons under quiescent conditions of disk evolution where matter migrates inwards. We also study the decomposition and oxidation of the carbonaceous material during violent flash heating events, which are thought to be responsible for the formation of chondrules. It is found that the complex hydrocarbon components are removed from the solid disk matter at temperatures between 250 and 400 K, while the amorphous carbon component survives up to 1200 K. Without efficient carbon destruction during flash-heating associated with chondrule formation the carbon abundance of terrestrial planets, except for Mercury, would be not as low as it is found in cosmochemical studies. Chondrule formation seems to be a process that is crucial for the carbon-poor composition of the material of terrestrial planets. 
The electrolysis of CO$_2$ in molten carbonate has been introduced as an alternative mechanism to synthesize carbon nanomaterials inexpensively at high yield. Until recently, CO$_2$ was thought to be unreactive, making its removal a challenge. CO$_2$ is the main cause of anthropogenic global warming and its utilization and transformation into a stable, valuable material provides an incentivized pathway to mitigate climate change. This study focuses on controlled electrochemical conditions in molten lithium carbonate to split CO$_2$ absorbed from the atmosphere into into carbon nanotubes, and into various macroscopic assemblies of CNTs,, which may be useful for nano-filtration. Different CNTs, morphologies were prepared electrochemically by variation of the anode and cathode composition and architecture, electrolyte composition pre-electrolysis processing, and the variation of current application and current density. Individual CNT morphologies structures and the CNT molten carbonate growth mechanism are explored by SEM, TEM, HAADF EDX, XRD and Raman. The principle commercial technology for CNT production had been chemical vapor deposition, which is an order of magnitude more expensive, generally requires metallo-organics, rather than CO$_2$ as reactants, and can be highly energy and CO$_2$ emission intensive (carries a high carbon positive, rather than negative, footprint). 
Earth and other rocky objects in the inner Solar System are depleted in carbon compared to objects in the outer Solar System, the Sun, or the ISM. It is believed that this is a result of the selective removal of refractory carbon from primordial circumstellar material. In this work, we study the irreversible release of carbon into the gaseous environment via photolysis and pyrolysis of refractory carbonaceous material during the disk phase of the early Solar System. We analytically solve the one-dimensional advection equation and derive an explicit expression that describes the depletion of carbonaceous material in solids under the influence of radial and vertical transport. We find both depletion mechanisms individually fail to reproduce Solar System abundances under typical conditions. While radial transport only marginally restricts photodecomposition, it is the inefficient vertical transport that limits carbon depletion under these conditions. We show explicitly that an increase in the vertical mixing efficiency, and/or an increase in the directly irradiated disk volume, favors carbon depletion. Thermal decomposition requires a hot inner disk (> 500 K) beyond 3 AU to deplete the formation region of Earth and chondrites. We find FU Ori-type outbursts to produce these conditions such that moderately refractory compounds are depleted. However, such outbursts likely do not deplete the most refractory carbonaceous compounds beyond the innermost disk region. Hence, the refractory carbon abundance at 1 AU typically does not reach terrestrial levels. Nevertheless, under specific conditions, we find photolysis and pyrolysis combined to reproduce Solar System abundances. 
A new crypto token is proposed as an incentive mechanism to remove CO2 from the atmosphere permanently at gigaton scale. The token facilitates CO2 removal (CDR) by providing financial incentives to those that are removing CO2 and an opportunity to provide additional financial resources for CDR by the public. The new token will be native to a blockchain that uses a Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) consensus mechanism. The useful work will be conducted by direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) facilities that will compete with each other based on the amount of CO2 captured and permanently stored. In terms of energy consumption, we require that the entire process, comprising DACCS technology and all blockchain operations, be climate positive while accounting for life cycle analysis of equipment used. We describe the underlying reward mechanism coupled with a verification mechanism for CDR. In addition, we consider security features to limit attacks and fraudulent activity. Finally, we outline a roadmap of features that are necessary to fully implement and deploy such a system, but are beyond the current scope of this article. 
The choice of a reflective optical coating or filter material has to be adapted to the intended field of application. This is mainly determined by the required photon energy range or by the required reflection angle. Among various materials, nickel and rhodium are standard materials used as reflective coatings for synchrotron mirrors. Conversely, Aluminum is one of the most commonly used materials for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray filters. However, both of these types of optics are subject to carbon contamination, being increasingly problematic for the operation of the high-performance free electron laser (FEL) and synchrotron beamlines. For this reason, an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source has been used in conjunction with N2/O2/H2 and N2/H2 feedstock gas plasmas. Results from the chemical surface analysis of the above materials before and after plasma treatment using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are reported. We conclude that a favorable combination of an N2/H2 plasma feedstock gas mixture leads to the best chemical surface preservation of Ni, Rh, and Al while removing the carbon contaminations. However, this feedstock gas mixture does not remove C contaminations as rapidly as, e.g., a N2/O2/H2 plasma which induces the surface formation of NiO and NiOOH in Ni and RhOOH in Rh foils. As an applied case, we demonstrate the successful carbon removal from ultrathin Al filters previously used at the FERMI FEL1 using a N2/H2 plasma. 
In this paper, we report on the radiation resistance of 50-micron thick LGAD detectors manufactured at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler employing several different doping combinations of the gain layer. LGAD detectors with gain layer doping of Boron, Boron low-diffusion, Gallium, Carbonated Boron and Carbonated Gallium have been designed and successfully produced. These sensors have been exposed to neutron fluences up to $\phi_n \sim 3 \cdot 10^{16}\; n/cm^2$ and to proton fluences up to $\phi_p \sim 9\cdot10^{15}\; p/cm^2$ to test their radiation resistance. The experimental results show that Gallium-doped LGADs are more heavily affected by initial acceptor removal than Boron-doped LGAD, while the presence of Carbon reduces initial acceptor removal both for Gallium and Boron doping. Boron low-diffusion shows a higher radiation resistance than that of standard Boron implant, indicating a dependence of the initial acceptor removal mechanism upon the implant width. This study also demonstrates that proton irradiation is at least twice more effective in producing initial acceptor removal, making proton irradiation far more damaging than neutron irradiation. 
We demonstrate from molecular dynamics simulations that windowed carbon nanotubes can efficiently separate CO2 from the CO2/CH4 mixture, resembling polymeric hollow fibers for gas separation. Three CO2/CH4 mixtures with 30%, 50% and 80% CO2 are investigated as a function of applied pressure from 80 to 180 bar. In all simulated conditions, only CO2 permeation is observed; CH4 is completely rejected by the nitrogen-functionalized windows or pores on the nanotube wall in the accessible timescale, while maintaining a fast diffusion rate along the tube. The estimated time-dependent CO2 permeance ranges from 107 to 105 GPU (gas permeation unit), compared with ~100 GPU for typical polymeric membranes. CO2/CH4 selectivity is estimated to be ~108 from the difference in free-energy barriers of permeation. This work suggests that a windowed carbon nanotube can be used as a highly efficient medium, configurable in hollow-fiber-like modules, for removing CO2 from natural gas. 
The stability of graphene multivacancy systems is studied using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. This work describes the evolution of the energy of formation per carbon atom for zigzag and armchair complementary figures -i.e. the figure formed by the carbon atoms extracted from graphene to form the vacancy-. Multivacancy systems formed when armchair complementary figures are removed are more stable for higher orders (>5) in comparison with the zigzag ones. The case of the construction of a 6-order vacancy from a 5-order one (branch-like) is discussed with the dependence on the place where the extra carbon atom is removed from graphene. The stability of multivacancy systems could be explained through the relative positions of the pentagonal rings present in the resulting defected graphene structure, as the more relevant factor. Other secondary factors that affect the stability of a graphene multivacancy system are the dangling bonds magnetic arrangements and their steric hindrance. 
We use low-energy electron microscopy to investigate how graphene is removed from Ru(0001) and Ir(111) by reaction with oxygen. We find two mechanisms on Ru(0001). At short times, oxygen reacts with carbon monomers on the surrounding Ru surface, decreasing their concentration below the equilibrium value. This undersaturation causes a flux of carbon from graphene to the monomer gas. In this initial mechanism, graphene is etched at a rate that is given precisely by the same non-linear dependence on carbon monomer concentration that governs growth. Thus, during both growth and etching, carbon attaches and detaches to graphene as clusters of several carbon atoms. At later times, etching accelerates. We present evidence that this process involves intercalated oxygen, which destabilizes graphene. On Ir, this mechanism creates observable holes. It also occurs mostly quickly near wrinkles in the graphene islands, depends on the orientation of the graphene with respect to the Ir substrate, and, in contrast to the first mechanism, can increase the density of carbon monomers. We also observe that both layers of bilayer graphene islands on Ir etch together, not sequentially. 
The structure of $^{19,20,22}$C has been investigated using high-energy (about 240 MeV/nucleon) one- and two-neutron removal reactions on a carbon target. Measurements were made of the inclusive cross sections and momentum distributions for the charged residues. Narrow momentum distributions were observed for one-neutron removal from $^{19}$C and $^{20}$C and two-neutron removal from $^{22}$C. Two-neutron removal from $^{20}$C resulted in a relatively broad momentum distribution. The results are compared with eikonal-model calculations combined with shell-model structure information. The neutron-removal cross sections and associated momentum distributions are calculated for transitions to both the particle-bound and particle-unbound final states. The calculations take into account the population of the mass $A-1$ reaction residues, $^{A-1}$C, and, following one-neutron emission after one-neutron removal, the mass $A-2$ two-neutron removal residues, $^{A-2}$C. The smaller contributions of direct two-neutron removal, that populate the $^{A-2}$C residues in a single step, are also computed. The data and calculations are shown to be in good overall agreement and consistent with the predicted shell-model ground state configurations and the one-neutron overlaps with low-lying states in $^{18-21}$C. These suggest significant $\nu{s}_{1/2}^2$ valence neutron configurations in both $^{20}$C and $^{22}$C. The results for $^{22}$C strongly support the picture of $^{22}$C as a two-neutron halo nucleus with a dominant $\nu{s}_{1/2}^2$ ground state configuration. 
A Renewable Energy and Materials Economy (REME) is proposed as the solution to the climate change threat. REME mimics nature to produce carbon neutral liquid fuels and chemicals as well as carbon negative materials by using water, CO$_2$ from the atmosphere and renewable energy as inputs. By being in harmony with nature REME has a positive feedback between economic development and climate change protection. In REME the feedback driven accelerated rate of economic growth enables the climate change threat to be addressed in a timely manner. It is also cost-effective protection because it sequesters by monetizing the carbon removed from the air in carbon-based building materials. Thus, addressing the climate change threat is not a cost to the economy but a result of REME driven prosperity. 
Single-walled carbon nanotubes have been a candidate for outperforming silicon in ultrascaled transistors, but the realization of nanotube-based integrated circuits requires dense arrays of purely semiconducting species. Control over kinetics and thermodynamics in tube-catalyst systems plays a key role for direct growth of such nanotube arrays, and further progress requires the comprehensive understanding of seemingly contradictory reports on the growth kinetics. Here, we propose a universal kinetic model and provide its quantitative verification by ethanol-based isotope labeling experiments. While the removal of carbon from catalysts dominates the growth kinetics under a low supply of precursors, our kinetic model and experiments demonstrate that chirality-dependent growth rates emerge when sufficient amounts of carbon and etching agents are co-supplied. As the model can be extended to create kinetic maps as a function of gas compositions, our findings resolve discrepancies in literature and offer rational strategies for chirality selective growth for practical applications. 
Removal of impurities and aggregates from as-grown single walled-carbon nanotube (SWCNT) materials remains an important challenge in nanotube research and applications. We report a simple but effective purification method that uses permanent magnets to remove nanotube aggregates, as well as residual metallic catalyst, from surfactant-coated aqueous SWCNT suspensions. Samples have been characterized by optical absorption, fluorescence and Raman spectroscopies; AFM and near-IR fluorescence microscopies; and TGA. We found that magnetic purification gives samples with reduced absorption backgrounds and high fluorescence efficiencies comparable to those prepared by ultracentrifugation. Nanotubes in magnetically processed HiPco samples are at least 80% individualized. We propose that SWCNT aggregates are preferentially removed because they contain disproportionate amounts of ferromagnetic catalyst particles. As compared to ultracentrifugation, magnetic processing offers major advantages in cost, simplicity, energy consumption, and scalability. 
A mathematical model is developed for the process of mass transfer from a fluid flowing through a packed column. Mass loss, whether by absorption or adsorption, may be significant. This is appropriate for example when removing contaminants from flue gases. With small mass loss the model reduces to a simpler form which is appropriate to describe the removal of contaminants/pollutants from liquids. A case study is carried out for the removal of CO2 from a gas mixture passing over activated carbon. Using the experimental parameter values it is shown, via non-dimensionalisation, that certain terms may be neglected from the governing equations, resulting in a form which may be solved analytically using a travelling wave substitution. From this all important quantities throughout the column may be described; concentration of gaseous materials, amount of material available for mass transfer, fluid velocity and pressure. Results are verified by comparison with experimental data for the breakthrough curve (the amount of carbon measured at the column outlet). The advantage of the analytical expression over a purely numerical solution is that it can easily be used to optimise the process. In the final section we demonstrate how the model may be further reduced when small amounts of contaminant are removed. The model is shown to exhibit better agreement than established models when compared to experimental data for the removal of amoxicillin and congo red dye from water. 
Solvation of the lithium ion (Li+) in dimethoxyethane (DME) and propylene carbonate (PC) is of scientific significance and urgency in the context of lithium-ion batteries. I report PM7-MD simulations on the composition of Li+ solvation shells (SH) in a few DME/PC mixtures. The equimolar mixture features preferential solvation by PC, in agreement with classical MD studies. However, one DME molecule is always present in the first SH, supplementing the cage formed by five PC molecules. As PC molecules get removed, DME gradually substitutes vacant places. In the PC-poor mixtures, an entire SH is populated by five DME molecules. 
Water desalination by capacitive deionization (CDI) is performed via electrochemical cells consisting of two porous carbon electrodes. Upon transferring charge from one electrode to the other, ions are removed from the feedwater by electrosorption into electrical double layers (EDLs) within the micropores of the porous carbon. When using electrodes containing fixed chemical charge in the micropores, various counterintuitive observations have been made, such as "inverted CDI" where upon charging, ions are released from the electrode, and the feedwater is only desalinated when the cell is discharging. We set up an EDL model including chemical charge that explains these observations and makes predictions for a working range of enhanced desalination by CDI. 
We consider the Kondo effect arising from a hydrogen impurity in graphene. As a first approximation, the strong covalent bond to a carbon atom removes that carbon atom without breaking the $C_{3}$ rotation symmetry, and we only retain the Hubbard interaction on the three nearest neighbors of the removed carbon atom which then behave as magnetic impurities. These three impurity spins are coupled to three conduction channels with definite helicity, two of which support a diverging local density of states (LDOS) $\propto 1/ [ | \omega \ | \ln ^{2}( \Lambda /| \omega \ | \ ) \ ] $ near the Dirac point $\omega \rightarrow 0$ even though the bulk density of states vanishes linearly. We study the resulting 3-impurity multi-channel Kondo model using the numerical renormalization group method. For weak potential scattering, the ground state of the Kondo model is a particle-hole symmetric spin-$1/2$ doublet, with ferromagnetic coupling between the three impurity spins; for moderate potential scattering, the ground state becomes a particle-hole asymmetric spin singlet, with antiferromagnetic coupling between the three impurity spins. This behavior is inherited by the Anderson model containing the hydrogen impurity and all four carbon atoms in its vicinity. 
Gas has been detected in a number of debris disks. It is likely secondary, i.e. produced by colliding solids. Here, we report ALMA Band 8 observations of neutral carbon in the CO-rich debris disk around the 15--30 Myr old A-type star HD 32297. We find that C$^0$ is located in a ring at $\sim$110 au with a FWHM of $\sim$80 au, and has a mass of $(3.5\pm0.2)\times10^{-3}$ M$_\oplus$. Naively, such a surprisingly small mass can be accumulated from CO photo-dissociation in a time as short as $\sim$10$^4$ yr. We develop a simple model for gas production and destruction in this system, properly accounting for CO self-shielding and shielding by neutral carbon, and introducing a removal mechanism for carbon gas. We find that the most likely scenario to explain both C$^0$ and CO observations, is one where the carbon gas is rapidly removed on a timescale of order a thousand years and the system maintains a very high CO production rate of $\sim$15 M$_\oplus$ Myr$^{-1}$, much higher than the rate of dust grind-down. We propose a possible scenario to meet these peculiar conditions: the capture of carbon onto dust grains, followed by rapid CO re-formation and re-release. In steady state, CO would continuously be recycled, producing a CO-rich gas ring that shows no appreciable spreading over time. This picture might be extended to explain other gas-rich debris disks. 
Digitalization and sector coupling enable companies to turn into flexumers. By using the flexibility of their multi-energy system (MES), they reduce costs and carbon emissions while stabilizing the electricity system. However, to identify the necessary investments in energy conversion and storage technologies to leverage demand response (DR) potentials, companies need to assess the value of flexibility. Therefore, this study quantifies the flexibility value of a production company's MES by optimizing the synthesis, design, and operation of a decarbonizing MES considering self-consumption optimization, peak shaving, and integrated DR based on hourly prices and carbon emission factors (CEFs). The detailed case study of a beverage company in northern Germany considers vehicle-to-X of powered industrial trucks, power-to-heat on multiple temperatures, wind turbines, photovoltaic systems, and energy storage systems (thermal energy, electricity, and hydrogen). We propose and apply novel data-driven metrics to evaluate the intensity of price-based and CEF-based DR. The results reveal that flexibility usage reduces decarbonization costs (by 19-80% depending on electricity and carbon removal prices), total annual costs, operating carbon emissions, energy-weighted average prices and CEFs, and fossil energy dependency. The results also suggest that a net-zero operational carbon emission MES requires flexibility, which, in an economic case, is provided by a combination of different flexible technologies and storage systems that complement each other. While the value of flexibility depends on various market and consumer-specific factors such as electricity or carbon removal prices, this study highlights the importance of demand flexibility for the decarbonization of MESs. 
Configurationally disordered crystalline boron carbide, B$_{4}$C, is studied using first-principles calculations. We investigate both dilute and high concentrations of carbon-boron substitutional defects. For the latter purpose, we suggest a superatom's picture of the complex structure and combine it with a special quasi-random structure approach for disorder. In this way, we model a random distribution of high concentrations of the identified low-energy defects: 1) Bipolar defects and 2) Rotation of icosahedral carbon among the three polar-up sites. Additionally, the substitutional disorder of the icosahedral carbon at all six polar sites, as previously discussed in the literature, is also considered. Two configurational phase transitions from the ordered to the disordered configurations are predicted to take place upon increasing temperature using a mean-field approximation for the entropy. The first transition, at 870 K, induces substitutional disorder of the icosahedral carbon atoms among the three polar-up sites, meanwhile the second transition, at 2325 K, reveals the random substitution of the icosahedral carbon atoms at all six polar sites coexisting with bipolar defects. Already the first transition removes the monoclinic distortion existing in the ordered ground state configuration and restore the rhombohedral system (R3m). The restoration of inversion symmetry yielding the full rhombohedral symmetry (R-3m) on average, corresponding to what is reported in the literature, is achieved after the second transition. The electronic density of states, obtained from the disordered phases indicates a sensitivity of band gap to the degree of configurational disorder in B$_{4}$C. 
Effects of wave-driven Langmuir turbulence on the air-sea flux of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) are examined using large eddy simulations featuring actively reacting carbonate chemistry in the ocean mixed layer at small scales. Four strengths of Langmuir turbulence are examined with three types of carbonate chemistry: time-dependent, instantaneous equilibrium chemistry, and no reactions. The time-dependent model is obtained by reducing a detailed eight-species chemical mechanism using computational singular perturbation analysis, resulting in a quasi-steady-state approximation for hydrogen ion (H$^+$), i.e., fixed pH. The reduced mechanism is then integrated in two half-time steps before and after the advection solve using a Runge--Kutta--Chebyshev scheme that is robust for stiff systems of differential equations. The simulations show that, as the strength of Langmuir turbulence increases, CO$_2$ fluxes are enhanced by rapid overturning of the near-surface layer, which rivals the removal rate of CO$_2$ by time-dependent reactions. Equilibrium chemistry and non-reactive models are found to bring more and less carbon, respectively, into the ocean as compared to the more realistic time-dependent model. These results have implications for Earth system models that either neglect Langmuir turbulence or use equilibrium, instead of time-dependent, chemical mechanisms. 
We report first-principles calculations that clarify the formation energies and charge transition levels of native point defects and carbon clusters in the 4H polytype of silicon carbide (4H-SiC) under a carbon-rich condition. We applied a hybrid functional that reproduces the experimental bandgap of SiC well and offers reliable defect properties. For point defects, we investigated single vacancies, antisites, and interstitials of Si and C on relevant sites. For carbon clusters, we systematically introduced two additional C atoms into the perfect 4H-SiC lattice with and without removing Si atoms and performed structural optimization to identify stable defect configurations. We found that neutral Si antisites are energetically favorable among Si-point defects in a wide range of the Fermi level position around the intrinsic regime, whereas negatively-charged Si vacancies and a positively-charged Si interstitial on a site surrounded by three Si and three C atoms become favorable under n- and p-type conditions, respectively. For C-point defects, neutral C antisites are favorable under intrinsic and n-type conditions, whereas positively-charged C vacancies become favorable under p-type conditions. We also found that a di-carbon antisite is more favorable than a C-split interstitial, which is the most stable form of single C interstitials. 
As the number of detected rocky extrasolar planets increases, the question of whether their surfaces could be habitable is becoming more pertinent. On Earth, the long-term carbonate silicate cycle is able to regulate surface temperatures over timescales larger than one million years. Elevated temperatures enhance weathering, removing CO$_2$ from the atmosphere, which is subducted into the mantle. At mid-ocean ridges, CO$_2$ is supplied to the atmosphere from the interior. The carbon degassing flux is controlled by the melting depth beneath mid-ocean ridges and the spreading rate, influenced by the pressure- and temperature-dependent mantle viscosity. The influences of temperature and pressure on mantle degassing become increasingly important for more massive planets. Here, we couple a thermal evolution model of Earth-like planets of different masses with a model of the long-term carbon cycle and assess their surface temperature evolution. We find that the spreading rate at 4.5 Gyr increases with planetary mass up to 3 $M_\oplus$, since the temperature-dependence of viscosity dominates over its pressure-dependency. For higher mass planets, pressure-dependence dominates and the plates slow down. In addition, the effective melting depth at 4.5 Gyr as a function of planetary mass has its maximum at 3 $M_\oplus$. Altogether, at 4.5 Gyr, the degassing rate and therefore surface temperature have their maximum at 3 $M_\oplus$. This work emphasizes that both age and mass should be considered when predicting the habitability of exoplanets. Despite these effects, the long-term carbon cycle remains an effective mechanism that regulates the surface temperature of massive Earth-like planets. 
Single electron transistors (SETs) made from single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising for quantum electronic devices operating with ultra-low power consumption and allow fundamental studies of electron transport. We report on SETs made by registered in-plane growth utilizing tailored nanoscale catalyst patterns and chemical vapor deposition. Metallic SWCNTs have been removed by an electrical burn-in technique and the common gate hysteresis was removed using PMMA and baking, leading to field effect transistors with large on/off ratios up to 10^5. Further segmentation into 200 nm short semiconducting SWCNT devices created quantum dots which display conductance oscillations in the Coulomb blockade regime. The demonstrated utilization of registered in-plane growth opens possibilities to create novel SET device geometries which are more complex, i.e. laterally ordered and scalable, as required for advanced quantum electronic devices. 
Until recently, analysis of optimal global climate policy has focused on mitigation. Exploration of policies to meet the 1.5{\deg}C target have brought carbon dioxide removal (CDR), a second instrument, into the climate policy mainstream. Far less agreement exists regarding the role of solar geoengineering (SG), a third instrument to limit global climate risk. Integrated assessment modelling (IAM) studies offer little guidance on trade-offs between these three instruments because they have dealt with CDR and SG in isolation. Here, I extend the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and Economy (DICE) to include both CDR and SG to explore the temporal ordering of the three instruments. Contrary to implicit assumptions that SG would be employed only after mitigation and CDR are exhausted, I find that SG is introduced parallel to mitigation temporary reducing climate risks during the era of peak CO2 concentrations. CDR reduces concentrations after mitigation is exhausted, enabling SG phasing out. 
The extra CO2 that has already been released into the atmosphere has to be removed in order to create a world that is carbon neutral. Technologies have been created to remove carbon dioxide from wet flue gas or even directly from ambient air, however these technologies are not widely deployed yet. New generations of creative CO2 capture sorbents have been produced as a consequence of recent improvements in material assembly and surface chemistry. We summarize recent progress on water-stable and encapsulated metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for CO2 capture under a wide range of environmental and operating conditions. In particular, newly developed water-stable MOFs and hydrophobic coating technologies are discussed with insights into their materials discovery and the synergistic effects between different components of these hybrid sorbent systems. The future perspectives and directions of water-stable and encapsulated MOFs are also given for Direct Air Capture of CO2 and CO2 capture from wet flue gas. 
Computer experiments concerning interactions between a graphite surface and the rigid pyramidal nanoasperity of a friction force microscope tip when it is brought close to and retracted from the graphitic sample are presented. Covalent atomic bonds in graphene layers are described using a Brenner potential and tip-carbon forces are derived from the Lennard-Jones potential. For interlayer interactions a registry-dependent potential with local normals is used. The behavior of the system is investigated under conditions of different magnitudes of tip-sample interaction and indentation rates. Strong forces between the nanoasperity and carbon atoms facilitate the cleavage of the graphite surface. Exfoliation, i. e. total removal of the upper graphitic layer, is observed when a highly adhesive tip is moved relative to the surface at low rates, while high rates cause the formation of a small flake attached to the tip. The results obtained may be valuable for enhancing our understanding of the superlubricity of graphite. 
In this work we present ab initio calculations of the formation energies and stability of different types of multi-vacancies in carbon nanotubes. We demonstrate that, as in the case of graphene, the reconstruction of the defects has drastic effects on the energetics of the tubes. In particular, the formation of pentagons eliminates the dangling bonds thus lowering the formation energy. This competition leads to vacancies having an even number of carbon atoms removed to be more stable. Finally the appearance of magic numbers indicating more stable defects can be represented by a model for the formation energies that is based on the number of dangling bonds of the unreconstructed system, the pentagons and the relaxation of the final form of the defect formed after the relaxation. 
Inkjet printing has been used to fabricate glucose sensors using glucose oxidase and screen printed carbon electrodes. By appropriate selection of printing and drying conditions we are able to fabricate sensor structures that show a good linear response to glucose concentration. In order to achieve these structures we must carefully control the spreading and drying of the enzyme solution on the carbon electrode. Carbon electrode suirfaces are hydrophobic and Triton X was used as a surfactant to allow full coverage of the electrode surface. During drying, under ambient conditions the enzyme solution segregates to form a ring deposit (coffee staining). Coffee staining is shown to be deleterious to sensor performance and it can be removed by drying in a reduced humidity environment. 
Since graphene, a single sheet of graphite, has all of its carbon atoms on the surface, its property is very sensitive to materials contacting the surface. Herein, we report novel Raman peaks ob-served in annealed graphene and elucidate their chemical origins by Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Graphene annealed in oxygen-free atmosphere revealed very broad additional Raman peaks overlapping the D, G and 2D peaks of graphene itself. Based on the topographic confirmation by AFM, the new Raman peaks were attributed to amorphous carbon formed on the surface of graphene by carbonization of environmental hydrocarbons. While the carbonaceous layers were formed for a wide range of annealing temperature and time, they could be effectively removed by prolonged annealing in vacuum. This study underlines that spectral features of graphene and presumably other 2-dimensional ma-terials are highly vulnerable to interference by foreign materials of molecular thickness. 
Supported carbon nanosheets and carbon nanotubes served as sacrificial templates for preparing spacious TiO2 photocatalytic thin films. Amorphous TiO2 was deposited conformally on the carbonaceous template material by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Upon calcination at 550{\deg}C, the carbon template was oxidatively removed and the as-deposited continuous amorphous TiO2 layers transformed into interlinked anatase nanoparticles with an overall morphology commensurate to the original template structure. The effect of type of template, number of ALD cycles and gas residence time of pollutant on the photocatalytic activity, as well as the stability of the photocatalytic performance of these thin films was investigated. The TiO2 films exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity towards photocatalytic degradation of acetaldehyde in air as a model reaction for photocatalytic indoor air pollution abatement. Optimized films outperformed a reference film of commercial PC500. 
Highly ordered and self supported anatase TiO2 nanoparticle chains were fabricated by calcining conformally TiO2 coated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). During annealing, the thin tubular TiO2 coating that was deposited onto the MWCNTs by atomic layer deposition (ALD) was transformed into chains of TiO2 nanoparticles (~12 nm diameter) with an ultrahigh surface area (137 cm2 per cm2 of substrate), while at the same time the carbon from the MWCNTs was removed. Photocatalytic tests on the degradation of acetaldehyde proved that these forests of TiO2 nanoparticle chains are highly photo active under UV light because of their well crystallized anatase phase. 
We present a simple torsional potential for graphene to accurately describe its out-of-plane deformations. The parameters of the potential are derived through appropriate fitting with suitable DFT calculations regarding the deformation energy of graphene sheets folded around two different folding axes, along an armchair or along a zig-zag direction. Removing the energetic contribution of bending angles, using a previously introduced angle bending potential, we isolate the purely torsional deformation energy, which is then fitted to simple torsional force fields. The presented out-of-plane torsional potential can accurately fit the deformation energy for relatively large torsional angles up to 0.5 rad. To test our proposed potential, we apply it to the problem of the vertical displacement of a single carbon atom out of the graphene plane and compare the obtained deformation energy with corresponding DFT calculations. The dependence of the deformation energy on the vertical displacement of the pulled carbon atom is indistinguishable in these two cases, for displacements up to about 0.5 $\AA$. The presented potential is applicable to other sp$^2$ carbon structures. 
We study the energy level structures of the defective graphane lattice, where a carbon dimer defect is created by removing the hydrogen atoms on two nearest-neighbor carbon sites. Robust defect states emerge inside the bulk insulating gap of graphane. While for the stoichiometric half-filled system there are two doubly degenerate defect levels, there are four nondegenerate and spin-polarized in-gap defect levels in the system with one electron less than half filling. A universal set of quantum gates can be realized in the defective graphane lattice, by triggering resonant transitions among the defect states via optical pulses and \emph{ac} magnetic fields. The sizable energy separation between the occupied and the empty in-gap states enables precise control at room temperature. The spatial locality of the in-gap states implies a qubit network of extremely high areal density. Based on these results, we propose that graphane as a unique platform could be used to construct the future all-purpose quantum computers. 
The optimization of the microstructure of the UCx target is a key point since many years in the field of ISOL method. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the release of the fission products, especially those with short half-lives. Fourteen UCx samples were synthetized from different uranium and carbon sources using three mixing protocols. All carburized samples were systematically characterized in terms of nature and proportion phases, grain and aggregate size, open and close porosity proportion and open pore size distribution. Our results were analysed using a multivariate statistical approach in order to remove any subjective bias. Strong correlations between the physicochemical characteristics of the samples as well as the impact of the synthesis process have been highlighted. In particular, using carbon nanotubes as carbon source combined with a new method of mixing is the key parameter to limit the sintering and to obtain samples with small grains and a high porosity well distributed over small pores. Moreover the microstructure obtained proved to be stable at high temperature. 
How areas of land are allocated for different uses, such as forests, urban areas, and agriculture, has a large effect on the terrestrial carbon balance, and therefore climate change. Based on available historical data on land-use changes and a simulation of the associated carbon emissions and removals, a surrogate model can be learned that makes it possible to evaluate the different options available to decision-makers efficiently. An evolutionary search process can then be used to discover effective land-use policies for specific locations. Such a system was built on the Project Resilience platform and evaluated with the Land-Use Harmonization dataset LUH2 and the bookkeeping model BLUE. It generates Pareto fronts that trade off carbon impact and amount of land-use change customized to different locations, thus providing a potentially useful tool for land-use planning. 
We propose tabular two-dimensional correlation analysis for extracting features from multifaceted characterization data, essential for understanding material properties. This method visualizes similarities and phase lags in structural parameter changes through heatmaps, combining hierarchical clustering and asynchronous correlations. We applied the proposed method to datasets of carbon nanotube (CNTs) films annealed at various temperatures and revealed the complexity of their hierarchical structures, which include elements like voids, bundles, and amorphous carbon. Our analysis addresses the challenge of attempting to understand the sequence of structural changes, especially in multifaceted characterization data where 11 structural parameters derived from 8 characterization methods interact with complex behavior. The results show how phase lags (asynchronous changes from stimuli) and parameter similarities can illuminate the sequence of structural changes in materials, providing insights into phenomena like the removal of amorphous carbon and graphitization in annealed CNTs. This approach is beneficial even with limited data and holds promise for a wide range of material analyses, demonstrating its potential in elucidating complex material behaviors and properties. 
High purity iron is obtained from vanadium-titanium magnetite (VTM) by one-step coal-based direct reduction-smelting process with coal as reductant and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) as additives. Industrial experiments show that the process of treating molten iron with a large amount of Na2CO3 is effective in removing titanium from molten iron. However, the studies are rarely conducted in thermodynamic relationship between titanium and other components of molten iron, under the condition of a large amount of Na2CO3 additives. In this study, through the thermodynamic database software Factsage8.0, the effects of melting temperature, sodium content and oxygen content on the removal of titanium from molten iron are studied. The results of thermodynamic calculation show that the removal of titanium from molten iron needs to be under the condition of oxidation, and the temperature should be below the critical temperature of titanium removal (the highest temperature at which titanium can be removed). Relatively low temperature and high oxygen content contribute to the removal of titanium from molten iron. The high oxygen content is conducive to the simultaneous removal of titanium and phosphorus from molten iron. In addition, from a thermodynamic point of view, excessive sodium addition inhibits the removal of titanium from molten iron. 
Nitrate is an important pollutant in drinking water worldwide, and a number of methods exist for the removal of nitrate from water including ion exchange and reverse osmosis. However, these approaches suffer from a variety of disadvantages including requirements for supply and disposal of brine used for regeneration in ion exchange and low water recovery ratio for reverse osmosis. Here, we demonstrate the use of high surface area activated carbon electrodes functionalized with moieties having high affinity for adsorption of nitrate from aqueous solution, such as those used in ion exchange. Adsorption of surfactant molecules having a quaternary amine ionic group to the activated carbon surfaces provides functionalization of the surfaces without complex chemistries. The functionalized electrodes have adsorption capacities of about 80 mg NaNO$_3$ per gram of activated carbon material. Unlike a traditional ion exchanger, the functionalized surfaces can be repeatedly regenerated by the application of an electrostatic potential which displaces the bound NO$_3^-$ while leaving an excess of electronic charge on the electrode. The cell is completed by an inert counter electrode where Faradaic reactions occur during regeneration. Up to approximately 40% of the initial capacity of the electrode is accessible following electrical regeneration. 
Enhanced weathering (EW) with crushed basalt on farmlands is a promising scalable atmospheric carbon dioxide removal strategy that urgently requires performance assessment with commercial farming practices. Our large-scale replicated EW field trial in the heart of the U.S. Corn Belt shows cumulative time-integrated carbon sequestration of 15.4 +/- 4.1 t CO2 ha-1 over four years, with additional emissions mitigation of ~0.1 - 0.4 t CO2,e ha-1 yr-1 for soil nitrous oxide, a potent long-lived greenhouse gas. Maize and soybean yields increased 12-16% with EW following improved soil fertility, decreased soil acidification, and upregulation of root nutrient transport genes. Our findings suggest that widespread adoption of EW across farming sectors has the potential to contribute significantly to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goals and global food and soil security. 
The deposition of thin SiO$_x$C$_y$H$_z$ or SiO$_x$H$_y$ films by means of atmospheric pressure microplasma jets with admixture of Hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) and oxygen and the role of surface reactions in film growth are investigated. Two types of microplasma jets, one with a planar electrodes and operated in helium gas and the other one with a coaxial geometry operated in argon, are used to study the deposition process. The growth rate of the film and the carbon-content in the film are measured as a function of the O$_2$ and HMDSO admixture in the planar jet and are compared to mass spectrometry measurements of the consumption of HMDSO. Additionally, the localized nature of the jet-substrate interaction is utilized to study surface reactions by applying two jets on a rotating substrate. The addition of oxygen into the gas mixture increases HMDSO depletion and the growth rate and results in the deposition of carbon free films. The surface reaction is responsible for the carbon removal from the growing film. Moreover, carbon free films can be deposited even without addition of oxygen, when coaxial jet operated with argon is used for the surface treatment. We hypothesize that ions or excited species (metastables) could be responsible for the observed effect. 
We study theoretically the Kondo effect in carbon nanotube quantum dot attached to polarized electrodes. Since both spin and orbit degrees of freedom are involved in such a system, the electrode polarization contains the spin- and orbit-polarizations as well as the Kramers polarization in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling. In this paper we focus on the compensation effect of the effective fields induced by different polarizations by applying magnetic field. The main results are i) while the effective fields induced by the spin- and orbit-polarizations remove the degeneracy in the Kondo effect, the effective field induced by the Kramers polarization enhances the degeneracy through suppressing the spin-orbit coupling; ii) while the effective field induced by the spin-polarization can not be compensated by applying magnetic field, the effective field induced by the orbit-polarization can be compensated; and iii) the presence of the spin-orbit coupling does not change the compensation behavior observed in the case without the spin-orbit coupling. These results are observable in an ultraclean carbon-nanotube quantum dot attached to ferromagnetic contacts under a parallel applied magnetic field along the tube axis and it would deepen our understanding on the Kondo physics of the carbon nanotube quantum dot. 
A hybrid C/O/Ne white dwarf (WD) -- an unburned C/O core surrounded by an O/Ne/Na mantle -- can be formed if the carbon flame is quenched in a super-AGB (SAGB) star or white dwarf merger remnant. We show that this segregated hybrid structure becomes unstable to rapid mixing within 2,000 years of the onset of WD cooling. Carbon burning includes a weak reaction that removes electrons, resulting in a lower electron-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{\rm e}$) in the regions processed by carbon burning compared to the unburned C/O core, making the O/Ne mantle denser than the C/O core as the WD cools. This is unstable to efficient mixing. We use the results of $\texttt{MESA}$ models with different size C/O cores to quantify the rate at which the cores mix with the mantle as they cool. In all cases, we find that the WDs undergo significant core/mantle mixing on timescales shorter than the time available to grow the WD to the Chandrasekhar mass ($M_{\rm Ch}$) by accretion. As a result, hybrid WDs that reach $M_{\rm Ch}$ due to later accretion will have lower central carbon fractions than assumed thus far. We briefly discuss the implications of these results for the possibility of Type Ia supernovae from hybrid WDs. 
Chemically-reduced graphene-oxide-supported gold nanoparticles are considered here as catalytic materials for the reduction of oxygen in alkaline medium. Gold nanoparticles are prepared by the chemical reduction method, in which the NaBH4-prereduced Keggin-type phosphomolybdate heteropolyblue acts as the reducing agent for the precursor (HAuCl4). Polyoxmetallate (PMo12O403-) capping ligands stabilize gold nanoparticle deposits, facilitate their dispersion and attachment to carbon supports. Indeed, it is apparent from the independent diagnostic voltammetric experiments (in 0.5 mol dm-3 H2SO4) that heteropolymolybdates form readily stable adsorbates on nanostructures of both gold and carbon (reduced graphene oxide and Vulcan). It is reasonable to expect that the polyoxometallate-assisted nucleation of gold has occurred in the proximity of oxygenated defects existing on carbon substrates. Under conditions of electrochemical diagnostic experiments (performed in 0.1 mol dm-3 KOH): (i) the phosphomolybdate adsorbates are removed from the interface as they undergo dissolution in alkaline medium; and (ii) the Au nanoparticles (Au loading, 30 {\mu}g cm-2) remain well-dispersed on the carbon as evident from transmission electron microscopy. High electrocatalytic activity of the reduced-graphene oxide-supported Au nanoparticles toward reduction of oxygen in alkaline medium is demonstrated using cyclic and rotating ring-disk voltammetric experiments. Among important issues are possible activating interactions between gold and the support, as well as presence of structural defects existing on poorly organized graphitic structure of reduced graphene oxide (as evident from Raman spectroscopy). 
LIBS (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) is a versatile technique for multi-element analysis, offering rapid analysis with minimal sample preparation. However, challenges persist in baseline correction due to background radiation, causing non-linear interference with emission lines. This necessitates proper baseline correction for accurate quantification of elements in LIBS spectra. Our study focuses on the quantification of total carbon in soil samples, conducting a comparative analysis of filters and methods for noise removal and baseline correction in LIBS spectra. We exhaustively tested all combinations of filters and methods, optimizing their parameters to establish the strongest correlation between corrected spectra and carbon content in a training sample set. We then evaluated these combinations using optimized parameters on a separate test sample set. Through rigorous evaluation, we found that the combination of the Savitzky-Golay filter and the 4S Peak Filling method achieved the most effective baseline correction. This combination demonstrated a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.93 and a root mean square error of 0.21. Notably, it outperformed a linear regression model based solely on the carbon emission line at 193.04 nm, which yielded a correlation of 0.91 with a root mean square error of 0.26. Our proposed procedure presents a novel approach for baseline correction in LIBS spectra, opening new possibilities for the development of multivariate methods utilizing specific spectral ranges. 
Electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) based on complexes of iron and nitrogen in a carbon matrix (Fe-N-C) are a promising alternative to platinum group metal (PGM) based catalysts in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Further improvements of Fe-N-C catalysts would benefit from model thin film studies of activity and stability of catalytic sites, but synthesis of Fe-N-C model thin films is challenging. Here we report on synthesis and characterization of Fe-N-C thin films produced by co-sputtering iron and carbon in a reactive nitrogen atmosphere onto removable glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) tips. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements indicate that the Fe-N-C films deposited at high temperature are smoother than the films annealed at high temperature. ORR activity measured on the thin Fe-N-C films is greater for both high-temperature samples than for the room-temperature sample. From the analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data, exposure of the films to high temperatures results in increased graphitization of the carbon with the Fe-N-C films, and increased relative amount of graphitic and hydrogenated nitrogen species. Overall the results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of a thin film model system approach for studying active sites in PGM-free catalysts. 
The development of defect populations after proton irradiation of n-type 4H-SiC and subsequent annealing experiments is studied by means of deep level transient (DLTS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. A comprehensive model is suggested describing the evolution and interconversion of irradiation-induced point defects during annealing below 1000{\deg}C. The model proposes the EH4 and EH5 traps frequently found by DLTS to originate from the (+/0) charge transition level belonging to different configurations of the carbon antisite-carbon vacancy (CAV) complex. Furthermore, we show that the transformation channel between the silicon vacancy (VSi) and CAV is effectively blocked under n-type conditions, but becomes available in samples where the Fermi level has moved towards the center of the band gap due to irradiation-induced donor compensation. The annealing of VSi and the carbon vacancy (VC) is shown to be dominated by recombination with residual self-interstitials at temperatures of up to 400{\deg}C. Going to higher temperatures, a decay of the CAV pair density is reported which is closely correlated to a renewed increase of VC concentration. A conceivable explanation for this process is the dissociation of the CAV pair into separate carbon anitisites and VC defects. Lastly, the presented data supports the claim that the removal of free carriers in irradiated SiC is due to introduced compensating defects and not passivation of shallow nitrogen donors. 
The pre-industrial state of the global carbon cycle is a significant aspect of studies related to climate change. In this paper, we recall the power law kinetic representations of the pre-industrial models of Schmitz (2002) and Anderies et al. (2013) from our earlier work. The power law kinetic representations, as uniform formalism, allow for a more extensive analysis and comparison of the different models for the same system. Using the mathematical theories of chemical reaction networks (with power-law kinetics), this work extends the analysis of the kinetic representations of the two models and assesses the similarities and differences in their structural and dynamic properties in relation to model construction assumptions. The analysis includes but is not limited to the coincidence of kinetic and stoichiometric spaces of the networks, capacity for equilibria multiplicity and co-multiplicity, and absolute concentration robustness in some species. Moreover, we bring together previously published results about the power law kinetic representations of the two models and consolidate them with new observations here. We also illustrate how the pre-industrial model of Anderies et al. may serve as a building block in the analysis of a kinetic representation of a global carbon cycle with carbon dioxide removal intervention. 
With increasing concerns over climate change, scientists must imperatively acknowledge their share in CO2 emissions. Considering the large emissions associated with scientific traveling - especially international conferences - initiatives to mitigate such impact are blooming. With the COVID-19 pandemic shattering our notion of private/professional interactions, the moment should be seized to reinvent science conferences and collaborations with a model respectful of the environment. Yet, despite efforts to reduce the footprint of conferences, there is a lack of a robust approach based on reliable numbers (emissions, carbon offsetting/removals, etc.) to accompany this shift of paradigm. Here, considering a representative scientific society, the International Adsorption Society, we report on a case study of the problem: making conferences carbon neutral while respecting the needs of scientists. We first provide a quantitative analysis of the CO2 emissions for the IAS conference in 2022 related to accommodation, catering, flights, etc. Second, we conduct two surveys probing our community view on the carbon footprint of our activities. These surveys mirror each other, and were distributed two years before and in the aftermath of our triennial conference (also corresponding to pre/post COVID times). By combining the different parts, we propose ambitious recommendations to shape the future of conferences. 
In addition to reducing anthropogenic emissions of CO$_2$, it is increasingly clear we also need to remove CO$_2$ from the atmosphere in order to avoid some of the worst case scenarios for climate change. Geologic sequestration of CO$_2$ is among the most attractive approaches because of the large global capacity and long-time scales for storage. One mechanism of geologic storage is through carbon mineralization. Some mafic and ultramafic rocks contain minerals that will react with CO$_2$ in a carbonation reaction and convert it to carbonated minerals. This is effectively a permanent CO$_2$ storage mechanism. The geologic question we are faced with is then to locate, delineate and estimate the volume of potentially reactive rocks. Using a synthetic model that emulates a prospective site for carbon mineralization in British Columbia, we simulate and invert gravity and magnetic data to delineate reactive rocks. We begin by inverting each data set independently and introduce a proxy experiment to contend with the challenging problem of choosing an appropriate physical-property threshold to estimate volumes from the recovered model. We use this proxy experiment to estimate thresholds for standard, $\ell_2$ inversion of the gravity and magnetics, as well as for inversions which use sparse and compact norms. A Petrophysically and Geologically Guided Inversion (PGI) framework is used to construct quasi-geologic models from which volumes can be estimated directly. We apply the PGI framework to the magnetics and gravity data independently. The framework is also used to jointly invert these data and produce a model that is consistent with both data sets. Cumulative volume estimates with depth are informative and can help decide whether in situ or ex situ sequestration might be appropriate. Using each of the inverted models, we estimate cumulative volume of reactive rock as a function of depth. 
The carbon-capturing process with the aid of CO2 removal technology (CDRT) has been recognised as an alternative and a prominent approach to deep decarbonisation. However, the main hindrance is the enormous energy demand and the economic implication of CDRT if not effectively managed. Hence, a novel deep reinforcement learning agent (DRL), integrated with an automated hyperparameter selection feature, is proposed in this study for the real-time scheduling of a multi-energy system coupled with CDRT. Post-carbon capture systems (PCCS) and direct-air capture systems (DACS) are considered CDRT. Various possible configurations are evaluated using real-time multi-energy data of a district in Arizona and CDRT parameters from manufacturers' catalogues and pilot project documentation. The simulation results validate that an optimised soft-actor critic (SAC) algorithm outperformed the TD3 algorithm due to its maximum entropy feature. We then trained four (4) SAC agents, equivalent to the number of considered case studies, using optimised hyperparameter values and deployed them in real time for evaluation. The results show that the proposed DRL agent can meet the prosumers' multi-energy demand and schedule the CDRT energy demand economically without specified constraints violation. Also, the proposed DRL agent outperformed rule-based scheduling by 23.65%. However, the configuration with PCCS and solid-sorbent DACS is considered the most suitable configuration with a high CO2 captured-released ratio of 38.54, low CO2 released indicator value of 2.53, and a 36.5% reduction in CDR cost due to waste heat utilisation and high absorption capacity of the selected sorbent. However, the adoption of CDRT is not economically viable at the current carbon price. Finally, we showed that CDRT would be attractive at a carbon price of 400-450USD/ton with the provision of tax incentives by the policymakers. 
Respirators provide protection from inhalation exposure to dangerous substances, such as chemicals and infectious particles, including SARS-Covid-laden droplets and aerosols. However, they are prone to exposure to stale air as the masks creat a microclimate influenced by the exhaled air. As a result, exhaled air from the lungs accumulating in the mask produce a warm and humid environment that has a high concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), unsuitable for re-inhalation. Fans are a favourable option for respirators to ventilate the mask and remove the stale air. This study utilized computational fluid dynamics simulation consisting of a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)-large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence method to compare the inhalation flow properties for different fan locations (bottom, top, and side) with regular respirator breathing. Three mask positions, top, side, and bottom, were evaluated under two breathing cycles (approximately 9.65s of breathing time). The results demonstrated that adding a fan respirator significantly decreased internal mask temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration. The average CO2 concentration decreased by 87%, 67% and 73% for locations bottom, top and side respectively. Whilst the top and side fan locations enhanced the removal of the exhaled gas mixture, the bottom-fan respirator was more efficient in removing the nostril jet gas mixture and therefore provided the least barrier to respiratory function. The results provide valuable insights into the benefits of fan respirators for long-term use for reducing CO2 concentration, mask temperature, and humidity, improving wearer safety and comfort in hazardous environments, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Subsurface flows, particularly hyporheic exchange fluxes, driven by streambed topography, permeability, channel gradient and dynamic flow conditions provide prominent ecological services such as nitrate removal from streams and aquifers. Stream flow dynamics cause strongly nonlinear and often episodic contributions of nutrient concentrations in river-aquifer systems. Using a fully coupled transient flow and reactive transport model, we investigated the denitrification potential of hyporheic zones during peak-flow events. The effects of streambed permeability, channel gradient and bedform amplitude on the spatio-temporal distribution of nitrate and dissolved organic carbon in streambeds and the associated denitrification potential were explored. Distinct peak-flow events with different intensity, duration and hydrograph shape were selected to represent a wide range of peak-flow scenarios. Our results indicated that the specific hydrodynamic characteristics of individual flow events largely determine the average positive or negative nitrate removal capacity of hyporheic zones, however the magnitude of this capacity is controlled by geomorphological settings (i.e. channel slope, streambed permeability and bedform amplitude). Specifically, events with longer duration and higher intensity were shown to promote higher nitrate removal efficiency with higher magnitude of removal efficiency in the scenarios with higher slope and permeability values. These results are essential for better assessment of the subsurface nitrate removal capacity under the influence of flow dynamics and particularly peak-flow events in order to provide tailored solutions for effective restoration of interconnected river-aquifer systems. 
Here, we report the performance of vacancy affected supercell of a hybrid Graphene-Boron Nitride embedded armchair nanoribbon (a-GNR-BN) based n-MOSFET at its ballistic transport limit using Non Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) methodology. A supercell is made of the 3p configuration of armchair nanoribbon that is doped on the either side with 6 BN atoms and is also H-passivated. The type of vacancies studied are mono (B removal), di (B and N atom removal) and hole (removal of 6 atoms) formed all at the interface of carbon and BN atoms. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is employed to evaluate the material properties of this supercell like bandgap, effective mass and density of states (DOS). Further band gap and effective mass are utilized in self-consistent PoissonSchrodinger calculator formalized using NEGF approach. For all the vacancy defects, material properties show a decrease which is more significant for hole defects. This observation is consistent in the device characteristics as well where ON-current (ION ) and Sub Threshold Slope (SS) shows the maximum increment for hole vacancy and increase is more significant becomes when the number of defects increase. 
Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a fast-emerging technology most commonly applied to brackish water desalination. In CDI, salt ions are removed from the feedwater and stored in electric double layers (EDLs) within micropores of electrically charged porous carbon electrodes. Recent experiments have demonstrated that CDI electrodes exhibit selective ion removal based on ion size, with the smaller ion being preferentially removed in the case of equal-valence ions. However, state-of-the-art CDI theory does not capture this observed selectivity, as it assumes volume-less point ions in the micropore EDLs. We here present a theory which includes multiple couterionic species, and relaxes the point ion assumption by incorporating ion volume exclusion interactions into a description of the micropore EDLs. The developed model is a coupled set of nonlinear algebraic equations which can be solved for micropore ion concentrations and electrode Donnan potential at cell equilibrium. We demonstrate that this model captures key features of the experimentally observed size-based ion selectivity of CDI electrodes. 
We report on the in-beam gamma spectroscopy of $^{102}$Sn and $^{100}$Cd produced via two-neutron removal from carbon and CH$_2$ targets at about 150 MeV/nucleon beam energy. New transitions assigned to the decay of a second 2$^+$ excited state at 2470(60) keV in $^{102}$Sn were observed. Two-neutron removal cross sections from $^{104}$Sn and $^{102}$Cd have been extracted. The enhanced cross section to the 2$^+_2$ in $^{102}$Sn populated via the $(p,p2n)$ reaction is traced back to an increase of shell-model structure overlaps, consistent with the hypothesis that the proton-induced two-deeply-bound-nucleon removal mechanism is of direct nature. 
Whether supernovae are major sources of dust in galaxies is a long-standing debate. We present infrared and submillimeter photometry and spectroscopy from the Herschel Space Observatory of the Crab Nebula between 51 and 670 micron as part of the Mass Loss from Evolved StarS program. We compare the emission detected with Herschel with multiwavelength data including millimeter, radio, mid-infrared and archive optical images. We carefully remove the synchrotron component using the Herschel and Planck fluxes measured in the same epoch. The contribution from line emission is removed using Herschel spectroscopy combined with Infrared Space Observatory archive data. Several forbidden lines of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are detected where multiple velocity components are resolved, deduced to be from the nitrogen-depleted, carbon-rich ejecta. No spectral lines are detected in the SPIRE wavebands; in the PACS bands, the line contribution is 5% and 10% at 70 and 100 micron and negligible at 160 micron. After subtracting the synchrotron and line emission, the remaining far-infrared continuum can be fit with two dust components. Assuming standard interstellar silicates, the mass of the cooler component is 0.24(+0.32)(-0.08) Msolar for T = 28.1(+5.5)(-3.2)K. Amorphous carbon grains require 0.11 +/- 0.01 Msolar of dust with T = 33.8(+2.3)(-1.8) K. A single temperature modified-blackbody with 0.14Msolar and 0.08Msolar for silicate and carbon dust respectively, provides an adequate fit to the far- infrared region of the spectral energy distribution but is a poor fit at 24-500 micron. The Crab Nebula has condensed most of the relevant refractory elements into dust, suggesting the formation of dust in core-collapse supernova ejecta is efficient. 
Rapid fluctuations are observed in the tensor-polarization $p_{zz}$ of deuteron beams forward-transmitted through graphite targets. Unpolarized 9.50 to 18.60\,MeV beams from the K\"oln tandem accelerator were utilized, and the polarization behind seven 36 to 188\,mg/cm$^{2}$ targets was measured with a polarimeter based on the $^{3}{\rm He}(\vec{d},p)^{4}{\rm He}$ reaction. Due to the chosen relation between the areal target densities and the initial beam energies $E_{\rm in}$, the seven sets of $p_{zz}(E_{\rm in})$ can be combined in a common plot as a function of $E_{\rm in}$. This allows one to understand $p_{zz}$, measured behind the 188\,mg/cm$^{2}$ target at $E_{\rm in}$=18.6\,MeV, as resulting from the sequence of differential polarization production $\Delta p_{zz}(E)/\Delta E$ during energy degradation in the target from $E$=18.60 to 9.50\,MeV. The rapid fluctuations of $\Delta p_{zz}(E)/\Delta E$$p_{zz}$ are described by 51 Gaussian-distributed cross-sections removing deuterons either in the $m=0$ or in the $m=\pm 1$ state from the beam. The 51 fitted central energies $E_{0}$ with a single exception agree with the energies of the narrow peaks in the excitation functions of the weak, isospin-breaking $^{12}{\rm C}(d,\alpha_{2})^{10}{\rm B}^{*}(1.74\,{\rm MeV},J^{\pi}=0^{+},T=1)$ reaction with population of the second excited $^{10}{\rm B}$ state via intermediate excited $^{14}$N states. Strong evidence is found that removal of deuterons in the $m=0$ ($m=\pm 1$) state from the beam leads to the formation of $^{14}$N states of established positive (negative) parity. As an application, the removal cross-section functions allow to calculate $p_{zz}$ achievable with carbon targets for initial beam energies $E_{\rm in}$ between 18.60 and 9.50\,MeV and $E_{\rm out}$ given by the areal target density. Carbon layers in a sandwich technique would enable $p_{zz}$ between -0.4 and +0.3. 
Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) is a promising scalable and cost-effective Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategy with significant environmental and agronomic co-benefits. A major barrier to large-scale implementation of ERW is a robust Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework. To successfully quantify the amount of carbon dioxide removed by ERW, MRV must be accurate, precise, and cost-effective. Here, we outline a mass-balance-based method where analysis of the chemical composition of soil samples is used to track in-situ silicate rock weathering. We show that signal-to-noise issues of in-situ soil analysis can be mitigated by using isotope-dilution mass spectrometry to reduce analytical error. We implement a proof-of-concept experiment demonstrating the method in controlled mesocosms. In our experiment, basalt rock feedstock is added to soil columns containing the cereal crop Sorghum bicolor at a rate equivalent to 50 t ha$^{-1}$. Using our approach, we calculate rock weathering corresponding to an average initial CDR value of 1.44 +/- 0.27 tCO$_2$eq ha$^{-1}$ from our experiments after 235 days, within error of an independent estimate calculated using conventional elemental budgeting of reaction products. Our method provides a robust time-integrated estimate of initial CDR, to feed into models that track and validate large-scale carbon removal through ERW. 
Methanol ice is embedded in interstellar ice mantles present in dense molecular clouds. We aim to measure the sputtering efficiencies starting from different ice mantles of varying compositions experimentally, in order to evaluate their potential impact on astrochemical models. The sputtering yields of complex organic molecules is of particular interest, since few mechanisms are efficient enough to induce a significant feedback to the gas phase. We irradiated methanol and carbon dioxide ice mixtures of varying ratios with swift heavy ions in the electronic sputtering regime. We monitored the evolution of the infrared spectra and the species released to the gas phase with a mass spectrometer. Methanol and 13C-methanol isotopologue were used to remove any ambiguity on the measured irradiation products. The sputtering of methanol embedded in carbon dioxide ice is an efficient process leading to the ejection of intact methanol in the gas phase. We establish that when methanol is embedded in a carbon-dioxide-rich mantle exposed to cosmic rays, a significant fraction is sputtered as intact molecules. The sputtered fraction follows the time-dependent bulk composition of the ice mantle, the latter evolving with time due to the radiolysis-induced evolution of the bulk. If methanol is embedded in a carbon dioxide ice matrix, as the analyses of the spectral shape of the CO2 bending mode observations in some lines of sight suggest, the overall methanol sputtering yield is higher than if embedded in a water ice mantle. The sputtering is increased by a factor close to the dominant ice matrix sputtering yield, which is about six times higher for pure carbon dioxide ice when compared to water ice. These experiments are further constraining the cosmic-ray-induced ice mantle sputtering mechanisms important role in the gas-phase release of complex organic molecules from the interstellar solid phase. 
Generating and detecting radiation in the technologically relevant range of the so-called terahertz gap ($0.1 - 10$ THz) is challenging because of a lack of efficient sources and detectors. Quantum dots in carbon nanotubes have shown great potential to build sensitive terahertz detectors usually based on photon-assisted tunnelling. A recently reported mechanism combining resonant quantum dot transitions and tunnelling barriers asymmetries results in a narrow linewidth photocurrent response with a large signal-to-noise ratio under weak THz radiation. That device was sensitive to one frequency, corresponding to transitions between equidistant quantized states. In this work we show, using numerical together with scanning tunnelling spectroscopy studies of a defect-induced metallic zigzag single-walled carbon nanotube quantum dot that simultaneously breaking various symmetries in metallic nanotube quantum dots of arbitrary chirality strongly relaxes the selection rules in the electric dipole approximation, and removes energy degeneracies. This leads to a richer set of allowed optical transitions spanning frequencies from 1 THz to several tens of THz, for a $\sim$10 nm quantum dot. Based on these findings, we propose a terahertz detector device based on a metallic single-walled carbon nanotube quantum dot defined by artificial defects. Depending on its length and contacts transparency, the operating regimes range from a high-resolution gate-tunable terahertz sensor to a broadband terahertz detector. Our calculations indicate that the device is largely unaffected by temperatures up to 100 K, making carbon nanotube quantum dots with broken symmetries a promising platform to design tunable terahertz detectors that could operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures. 
Abatement options for the hard-to-electrify parts of the transport sector are needed to achieve ambitious emissions targets. Biofuels based on biomass, electrofuels based on renewable hydrogen and a carbon source, as well as fossil fuels compensated by carbon dioxide removal (CDR) are the main options. Currently, biofuels are the only renewable fuels available at scale and are stimulated by blending mandates. Here, we estimate the system cost of enforcing such mandates in addition to an overall emissions cap for all energy sectors. We model overnight scenarios for 2040 and 2060 with the sector-coupled European energy system model PyPSA-Eur-Sec, with a high temporal resolution. The following cost drivers are identified: (i) high biomass costs due to scarcity, (ii) opportunity costs for competing usages of biomass for industry heat and combined heat and power (CHP) with carbon capture, and (iii) lower scalability and generally higher cost for biofuels compared to electrofuels and fossil fuels combined with CDR. With a -80% emissions reduction target in 2040, variable renewables, partial electrification of heat, industry and transport and biomass use for CHP and industrial heat are important for achieving the target at minimal cost. Abatement of remaining liquid fossil fuel use increases system cost, with a 50% biofuel mandate increasing costs by 128-229 billion EUR, or 39-82% of the liquid fuel cost. With a negative -105% emissions target in 2060, fuel abatement options are necessary, and electrofuels or the use of CDR to offset fossil fuel emissions are more competitive than biofuels. Biomass is preferred in CHP and industry heat, combined with carbon capture to serve negative emissions or electrofuel production, thereby utilising biogenic carbon several times. Sensitivity analyses reveal significant uncertainties but consistently support that higher biofuel mandates lead to higher costs. 
Solar steam generation, a sustainable water-purification technology, holds substantial promises in resolving the global issue of shortage of drinkable water. Here, we report the design, fabrication, and performance of an innovative three-dimensional (3-D) solar steamer, offering synergistic high-rate steaming and heavy metal removal functions. The device is made of synthesized carbon-molybdenum-disulfide microbeads electrostatically assembled on a 3-D polyurethane sponge. The mesoporous composite sponge also serves as a freestanding water reservoir that avoids one-side contact to bulk water, effectively suppressing the commonly observed parasitic heat loss, and offering a high energy efficiency of 88%. When being sculptured into a 3-D spoke-like structure, the composite sponge achieves one of the highest evaporation rates of 1.95 kg m-2 h-1 at 1 sun. The solar steamer is demonstrated for water treatment, i.e. decontamination of metal ions, disinfection, and reducing alkalinity and hardness of river water. Particularly, the strong mercury adsorption of MoS2 reduces Mercury from 200 to 1ppb, meeting the stringent standard set by the Environmental Protection Agency, which is the first demonstration of mercury-removal powered by solar energy. The unique design, fabrication, water-handling strategy, and mercury-removal function of this high-performance solar steamer could inspire new paradigms of water treatment technologies. 
A simple and effective stepwise-method has been developed to remove defects from the top graphene layers of highly orientated pyrolytic graphite. Using a combination of ozone exposure and moderately high temperature we have shown that a defect-rich graphite surface can be modified to generate a graphene-like surface containing a negligible amount of oxygen, hydrogen and sp3 carbon. We report definitive x-ray photoelectron and x-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis after each stage of the process, suggest a mechanism by which the modification occurs and propose it as a route towards the preparation or manipulation of pristine graphene samples. 
The temperature targets in the Paris Agreement cannot be met without very rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The latter requires large, perhaps prohibitively large subsidies. The central estimate of the costs of climate policy, unrealistically assuming least-cost implementation, is 3.8-5.6\% of GDP in 2100. The central estimate of the benefits of climate policy, unrealistically assuming constant vulnerability, is 2.8-3.2\% of GDP. The uncertainty about the benefits is larger than the uncertainty about the costs. The Paris targets do not pass the cost-benefit test unless risk aversion is high and discount rate low. 
Background: A metabolic genotype comprises all chemical reactions an organism can catalyze via enzymes encoded in its genome. A genotype is viable in a given environment if it is capable of producing all biomass components the organism needs to survive and reproduce. Previous work has focused on the properties of individual genotypes while little is known about how genome-scale metabolic networks with a given function can vary in their reaction content. Results: We here characterize spaces of such genotypes. Specifically, we study metabolic genotypes whose phenotype is viability in minimal chemical environments that differ in their sole carbon sources. We show that regardless of the number of reactions in a metabolic genotype, the genotypes of a given phenotype typically form vast, connected, and unstructured sets -- genotype networks -- that nearly span the whole of genotype space. The robustness of metabolic phenotypes to random reaction removal in such spaces has a narrow distribution with a high mean. Different carbon sources differ in the number of metabolic genotypes in their genotype network; this number decreases as a genotype is required to be viable on increasing numbers of carbon sources, but much less than if metabolic reactions were used independently across different chemical environments. Conclusions: Our work shows that phenotype-preserving genotype networks have generic organizational properties and that these properties are insensitive to the number of reactions in metabolic genotypes. 
Interstellar ubiquitous infrared spectrum (IR) due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) was observed in many astronomical dust clouds. A capable astronomical chemical evolution path from graphene to PAH was studied based on the first principles calculation. Step 1 is a nucleation of nano-carbon after supernova by super-cooling at expanding helium sphere. As a typical model, graphene molecule (C )24 having coronene skeleton with seven carbon hexagons was tried.Step 2 is a proton sputtering and passivation on ejected graphene molecule. Slow speed proton with energy less than 4.3eV makes hydrogenation, Graphene molecule (C )24 was transformed to PAH (C24H12). Higher speed proton having sufficient energy larger than 18.3 eV could make a void in a molecule as like C23H12. Resulted structure was a combination of two carbon pentagons and five hexagons. Step 3 is photo-ionization of those molecules by high energy photon. Electrons are removed to make a molecule to cation. Model molecule (C23H12) became mono-cation (C23H12)+, di-cation (C23H12)2+ and so on. Typical energy difference between such cation was 6.5 and 10.8 eV. If the light source has a nature of black-body radiation, effective temperature will be 18000K ~ 24000K, which suggested that central light source star may have 4 to 7 times heavier than our sun. Finally, theoretical IR spectrum was obtained. Especially in case of (C23H12)2+, calculated emission spectrum revealed that among 13 major peaks, 11 peaks could correlate with ubiquitous observed IR one. 
We report the results of X-ray spectroscopy and Raman measurements of as-prepared graphene on a high quality copper surface and the same materials after 1.5 years under different conditions (ambient and low humidity). The obtained results were compared with density functional theory calculations of the formation energies and electronic structures of various structural defects in graphene/Cu interfaces. For evaluation of the stability of the carbon cover, we propose a two-step model. The first step is oxidation of the graphene, and the second is perforation of graphene with the removal of carbon atoms as part of the carbon dioxide molecule. Results of the modeling and experimental measurements provide evidence that graphene grown on high-quality copper substrate becomes robust and stable in time (1.5 years). However, the stability of this interface depends on the quality of the graphene and the number of native defects in the graphene and substrate. The effect of the presence of a metallic substrate with defects on the stability and electronic structure of graphene is also discussed. 
All carbon materials, e.g., amorphous carbon (a-C) coatings and C60 fullerene thin films, play an important role in short-wavelength free-electron laser (FEL) research motivated by FEL optics development and prospective nanotechnology applications. Responses of a-C and C60 layers to the extreme ultraviolet (SPring-8 Compact SASE Source in Japan) and soft x-ray (free-electron laser in Hamburg) free-electron laser radiation are investigated by Raman spectroscopy, differential interference contrast, and atomic force microscopy. A remarkable difference in the behavior of covalent (a-C) and molecular (C60) carbonaceous solids is demonstrated under these irradiation conditions. Low thresholds for ablation of a fullerene crystal (estimated to be around 0.15 eV/atom for C60 vs 0.9 eV/atom for a-C in terms of the absorbed dose) are caused by a low cohesive energy of fullerene crystals. An efficient mechanism of the removal of intact C60 molecules from the irradiated crystal due to Coulomb repulsion of fullerene-cage cation radicals formed by the ionizing radiation is revealed by a detailed modeling. 
Subduction is a crucial part of the long-term water and carbon cycling between Earth's exosphere and interior. However, there is broad disagreement over how much water and carbon is liberated from subducting slabs to the mantle wedge and transported to island-arc volcanoes. In the companion paper Part I, we parameterize the metamorphic reactions involving H$_2$O and CO$_2$ for representative subducting lithologies. On this basis, a two-dimensional reactive transport model is constructed in this Part II. We assess the various controlling factors of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O release from subducting slabs. Model results show that up-slab fluid flow directions produce a flux peak of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O at subarc depths. Moreover, infiltration of H$_2$O-rich fluids sourced from hydrated slab mantle enhances decarbonation or carbonation at lithological interfaces, increases slab surface fluxes, and redistributes CO$_2$ from basalt and gabbro layers to the overlying sedimentary layer. As a result, removal of the cap sediments (by diapirism or off-scraping) leads to elevated slab surface CO$_2$ and H$_2$O fluxes. The modelled subduction efficiency (the percentage of initially subducted volatiles retained until $\sim$200 km deep) of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ is increased by open-system effects due to fractionation within the interior of lithological layers. 
The future ATLAS ITk strip tracker will consist of 17,000 silicon strip detector modules mounted on support structures called cores. Cores are assembled from a number of components, among others carbon fibre facings, honeycomb structure and carbon foam surrounding titanium tubes used for cooling, using a two-component epoxy (Hysol 9396) loaded with boron nitride for good thermal conductivity. The adhesive constitutes about 20 % of a core's weight. During operation, the detector is cooled down to -40 $^\circ$C using bi-phase carbon dioxide and flushed with dry gas to prevent condensation. The effect of this temperature change has been simulated to study the impact of Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) mismatches between different materials and investigate resulting deformations and misalignment. In addition to the shrinking of an adhesive during cooling, which can be estimated well using its known CTE, flushing the detector volume with dry gas removes the moisture contained in the adhesive, leading to an additional shrinking. In order to estimate the impact of shrinking during drying, the Coefficient of Moisture Expansion (CME) of Hysol samples with different contents of boron nitride as well as their overall moisture absorption were measured and their extent compared to the contraction associated with cooling. 
Substantial progress on field effect transistors "FETs" consisting of semiconducting single wall carbon nanotubes "s-SWNTs" without detectable traces of metallic nanotubes and impurities is reported. Nearly perfect removal of metallic nanotubes is confirmed by optical absorption, Raman measurements, and electrical measurements. This outstanding result was made possible in particular by ultracentrifugation (150 000 g) of solutions prepared from SWNT powders using polyfluorene as an extracting agent in toluene. Such s-SWNTs processable solutions were applied to realize FET, embodying randomly or preferentially oriented nanotube networks prepared by spin coating or dielectrophoresis. Devices exhibit stable p-type semiconductor behavior in air with very promising characteristics. The on-off current ratio is 10^5, the on-current level is around 10 $\mu$A, and the estimated hole mobility is larger than 2 cm2 / V s. 
We report ultra-high density assembly of aligned single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) two dimensional arrays via ac dielectrophoresis using high quality surfactant free and stable SWNT solutions. After optimization of frequency and trapping time, we can reproducibly control the linear density of the SWNT between prefabricated electrodes from 0.5 SWNT/\mum to more than 30 SWNT /\mum by tuning the concentration of the nanotubes in the solution. Our maximum density of 30 SWNT/\mum is the highest for aligned arrays via any solution processing technique reported so far. Further increase of SWNT concentration results dense array with multiple layers. We discuss how the orientation and density of the nanotubes vary with concentrations and channel lengths. Electrical measurement data show that the densely packed aligned arrays have low sheet resistances. Selective removal of metallic SWNTs via controlled electrical breakdown produced field effect transistors (FET) with high current on-off ratio. Ultra-high density alignment reported here will have important implications in fabricating high quality devices for digital and analog electronics. 
We investigate the problem of counting co-authorhip in order to quantify the impact and relevance of scientific research output through normalized \textit{h-index} and \textit{g-index}. We use the papers whose authors belong to a subset of full professors of the Italian Settore Scientifico Disciplinare (SSD) FIS01 - Experimental Physics. In this SSD two populations, characterized by the number of co-authors of each paper, are roughly present. The total number of citations for each individuals, as well as their h-index and g-index, strongly depends on the average number of co-authors. We show that, in order to remove the dependence of the various indices on the two populations, the best way to define a fractional counting of autorship is to divide the number of citations received by each paper by the square root of the number of co-authors. This allows us to obtain some information which can be used for a better understanding of the scientific knowledge made through the process of writing and publishing papers. 
While addition of electrolyte to sodium dodecyl sulfate suspensions of single-wall carbon nanotubes has been demonstrated to result in significant brightening of the nanotube photoluminescence (PL), the brightening mechanism has remained unresolved. Here, we probe this mechanism using time-resolved PL decay measurements. We find that PL decay times increase by a factor of 2 on addition of CsCl as the electrolyte. Such an increase directly parallels an observed near-doubling of PL intensity, indicating the brightening results primarily from changes in nonradiative decay rates associated with exciton diffusion to quenching sites. Our findings indicate that a reduced number of these sites results from electrolyte-induced reorientation of the surfactant surface structure that partially removes pockets of water from the tube surface where excitons can dissociate, and thus underscores the contribution of interfacial water in exciton recombination processes. 
The study of meter and sub-meter scale geological features, especially boulders and boulder fields, on the surface of airless bodies can provide insight into the evolution of the regolith and the contribution of various processes to its formation. Prior studies have examined the photometric properties of the lunar regolith surrounding young craters using image ratios. We extend this methodology to extracting surface properties, in particular the roughness characteristics, exclusive to boulder fields and the boulders that constitute them around impact craters. In this study, rock-rich regions on the Moon are investigated using photometric roughness by employing a normalised logarithmic phase ratio difference metric to measure and compare the slope of the phase curve (reflectance versus phase angle) of a rock-rich field to a rock-free field. We compare the photometric roughness of rock-rich fields on simulated images with the photometric roughness of rock-rich fields on LROC NAC images (0.5m/pixel). Using this technique, we determine that rock-rich surfaces are not necessarily photometrically rougher than rock-free areas. Additionally, we find the roughness of resolved rock fields to indicate the presence of diverse sub-mm scale rock roughness (microtopography) and, possibly, variable rock single scattering albedo. These latter properties are likely controlled by rock petrology and material response to weathering and erosion. Spatial clustering of photometrically smooth and rough boulder fields in the downrange and uprange of two craters is observed, reflecting ejecta asymmetry and possibly indicating asymmetric modification of ejecta rock surfaces during the impact excavation process. 
Weathering of silicate rocks at a planetary surface can draw down CO$_2$ from the atmosphere for eventual burial and long-term storage in the planetary interior. This process is thought to provide an essential negative feedback to the carbonate-silicate cycle (carbon cycle) to maintain clement climates on Earth and potentially similar temperate exoplanets. We implement thermodynamics to determine weathering rates as a function of surface lithology (rock type). These rates provide upper limits that allow estimating the maximum rate of weathering in regulating climate. This modeling shows that the weathering of mineral assemblages in a given rock, rather than individual minerals, is crucial to determine weathering rates at planetary surfaces. By implementing a fluid-transport controlled approach, we further mimic chemical kinetics and thermodynamics to determine weathering rates for three types of rocks inspired by the lithologies of Earth's continental and oceanic crust, and its upper mantle. We find that thermodynamic weathering rates of a continental crust-like lithology are about one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of a lithology characteristic of the oceanic crust. We show that when the CO$_2$ partial pressure decreases or surface temperature increases, thermodynamics rather than kinetics exerts a strong control on weathering. The kinetically- and thermodynamically-limited regimes of weathering depend on lithology, whereas, the supply-limited weathering is independent of lithology. Our results imply that the temperature-sensitivity of thermodynamically-limited silicate weathering may instigate a positive feedback to the carbon cycle, in which the weathering rate decreases as the surface temperature increases. 
Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) is a promising scalable and cost-effective Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategy with significant environmental and agronomic co-benefits. A major barrier to large-scale implementation of ERW is a robust Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework. To successfully quantify the amount of carbon dioxide removed by ERW, MRV must be accurate, precise, and cost-effective. Here, we outline a mass-balance-based method where analysis of the chemical composition of soil samples is used to track in-situ silicate rock weathering. We show that signal-to-noise issues of in-situ soil analysis can be mitigated by using isotope-dilution mass spectrometry to reduce analytical error. We implement a proof-of-concept experiment demonstrating the method in controlled mesocosms. In our experiment, basalt rock feedstock is added to soil columns containing the cereal crop Sorghum bicolor at a rate equivalent to 50 t ha$^{-1}$. Using our approach, we calculate rock weathering corresponding to an average initial CDR value of 1.44 +/- 0.27 tCO$_2$eq ha$^{-1}$ from our experiments after 235 days, within error of an independent estimate calculated using conventional elemental budgeting of reaction products. Our method provides a robust time-integrated estimate of initial CDR, to feed into models that track and validate large-scale carbon removal through ERW. 
The long-term carbon cycle is vital for maintaining liquid water oceans on rocky planets due to the negative climate feedbacks involved in silicate weathering. Plate tectonics plays a crucial role in driving the long-term carbon cycle because it is responsible for CO$_2$ degassing at ridges and arcs, the return of CO$_2$ to the mantle through subduction, and supplying fresh, weatherable rock to the surface via uplift and orogeny. However, the presence of plate tectonics itself may depend on climate according to recent geodynamical studies showing that cool surface temperatures are important for maintaining vigorous plate tectonics. Using a simple carbon cycle model, I show that the negative climate feedbacks inherent in the long-term carbon cycle are uninhibited by climate's effect on plate tectonics. Furthermore, initial atmospheric CO$_2$ conditions do not impact the final climate state reached when the carbon cycle comes to equilibrium, as long as liquid water is present and silicate weathering can occur. Thus an initially hot, CO$_2$ rich atmosphere does not prevent the development of a temperate climate and plate tectonics on a planet. However, globally supply-limited weathering does prevent the development of temperate climates on planets with small subaerial land areas and large total CO$_2$ budgets because supply-limited weathering lacks stabilizing climate feedbacks. Planets in the supply-limited regime may become inhospitable for life and could experience significant water loss. Supply-limited weathering is less likely on plate tectonic planets, because plate tectonics promotes high erosion rates and thus a greater supply of bedrock to the surface. 
Carbon dioxide will likely need to be removed from the atmosphere to avoid significant future warming and climate change. Technologies are being developed to remove large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere. Enhanced rock weathering (ERW), where fine-grained silicate minerals are spread on soil, is a promising carbon removal method that can also support crop yields and maintain overall soil health. Quantifying the amount of carbon removed by ERW is crucial for understanding the potential of ERW globally and for building trust in commercial operations. However, reliable and scalable quantification in complex media like soil is challenging and there is not yet a consensus on the best method of doing so. Here we discuss mass-balance methods, where stocks of base cations in soil are monitored over time to infer the amount of inorganic carbon brought into solution by weathering reactions. First, we review the fundamental concepts of mass-balance methods and explain different ways of approaching the mass-balance problem. Then we discuss experimental planning and data collection, suggesting some best practices. Next, we present a software package designed to facilitate a range of tasks in ERW like uncertainty analysis, planning field trials, and validating statistical methods. Finally, we briefly review ways of estimating carbon removal using mass balance before discussing some advantages of Bayesian inference in this context and presenting an example Bayesian model. The model is fit to simulated data and recovers the correct answer with a clear representation of uncertainty. 
Recent studies have shown that giant landslides seem to be correlated with climatic variations. Nevertheless, the precise processes that are involved in this phenomenon need to be better constrained. In this study, the causes of giant landslides are investigated using a modeling approach. Here, we show that the effect of meteoritic water infiltration could be discriminated from that of sea-level rise on triggering paleolandslides. It is possible to identify the cause of coastal paleolandslides based on the age of occurrence and comparison with climatic signals when glacial maxima are more humid than during interglacial times, as in Polynesia and East Equatorial Africa, but not in other cases (Caribbean, Indonesia). The role of pore pressure variations and sea-water loading variations has been discussed. The interaction between the relative sea-level rise, preexisting relief and deep weak structure due to the presence of highly weathered lavas may trigger the conditions for a large landslide. Highly weathered lavas have very low friction angles at depth in volcanic islands. When volcanoes are still actives, pressure variation of the magma chamber caused by sea-level lowering is expected to play a significant role in destabilization of the relief. Competing processes in real cases cause difficulties to discriminate between these processes. 
Planetary rotation rate has a significant effect on atmospheric circulation, where the strength of the Coriolis effect in part determines the efficiency of latitudinal heat transport, altering cloud distributions, surface temperatures, and precipitation patterns. In this study we use the ROCKE-3D dynamic-ocean general circulation model to study the effects of slow rotations and increased insolations on the 'fractional habitability' and silicate weathering rate of an Earth-like world. Defining the fractional habitability f_h to be the percentage of a planet's surface which falls in the 0 <= T <= 100 C temperature regime, we find a moderate increase in f_h with a 10% and 20% increase in insolation and a possible maximum in f_h at sidereal day-lengths between 8 and 32 times that of the modern Earth. By tracking precipitation and run-off we further determine that there is a rotational regime centered on a 4-day period in which the silicate weathering rate is maximized and is particularly strongly peaked at higher overall insolations. Because of weathering's integral role in the long-term carbonate-silicate cycle, we suggest that climate stability may be strongly affected by the anticipated rotational evolution of temperate terrestrial-type worlds, and should be considered a major factor in their study. In light of our results we argue that planetary rotation period is an important factor to consider when determining the habitability of terrestrial worlds. 
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey provides colors for more than 100 000 moving objects, among which around 10 000 have albedos determined. Here we combined colors and albedo in order to perform a cluster analysis on the small bodies population, and identify a C-cluster, a group of asteroid related to C-type as defined in earlier work. Members of this C-cluster are in fair agreement with the color boundaries of B and C-type defined in DeMeo and Carry (2013). We then compare colors of C-cluster asteroids to those of carbonaceous chondrites powders, while taking into account the effect of phase angle. We show that only CM chondrites have colors in the range of C-cluster asteroids, CO, CR and CV chondrites being significantly redder. Also, CM chondrites powders are on average slightly redder than the average C-cluster. The colors of C-cluster members are further investigated by looking at color variations as a function of asteroid diameter. We observe that the visible slope becomes bluer with decreasing asteroids diameter, and a transition seems to be present around 20 km. We discuss the origin of this variation and, if not related to a bias in the dataset - analysis, we conclude that it is related to the surface texture of the objects, smaller objects being covered by rocks, while larger objects are covered by a particulate surface. The blueing is interpreted by an increased contribution of the first reflection in the case of rock-dominated surfaces, which can scatter light in a Rayleigh-like manner. We do not have unambiguous evidence of space weathering within the C-cluster based on this analysis, however the generally bluer nature of C-cluster objects compared to CM chondrites could be to some extent related to space weathering. 
Understanding the co-evolution of complex life with Earth's geology is an enduring challenge. The rock record evidences remarkable correlations between changes in biology and the wider Earth system, yet cause and effect remain unclear. Here, we link the evolutionary history of eukaryotes with the rise and fall of carbonate rock fraction within continental crust - a key variable in controlling the efficiency of carbon drawdown during weathering, solid Earth degassing rates, and ultimately nutrient supply to life. We use geospatial database analyses to demonstrate a strongly non-linear growth and then collapse in Earth's continental crust carbonate reservoir. Biomineralisers reshaped Earth's surface in their image; armouring continental margins with carbonate platforms, such that the continental carbonate reservoir increased in size by 5-fold in under 100 Myr after the Cambrian Radiation of animal life. This Paleozoic carbonate revolution represents among the most dramatic crustal evolutionary events in Earth's history. The Permo-Triassic extinction event coupled to the rise of open ocean calcifiers initiated a steady decline in continental crustal carbonate content; one that still continues today, which unabated would produce Precambrian-style crustal carbonate distributions in around 500-1000 Myr. Our results demonstrate strongly non-linear crustal evolution after the rise of the complex Phanerozoic biosphere. This outcome suggests that complex life may generate unique biogeochemical trajectories on otherwise geologically similar worlds, posing a new challenge in the hunt for life beyond Earth. 
This concept article discusses the possibilities for identifying sedimentary-origin meteorites. The paper concerns (i) the macroscopic candidate for sedimentary meteorite in the epicenter of the 1908 Tunguska catastrophe; (ii) potential parent bodies for sedimentary meteorites; (iii) isotopic heterogeneity of unmixed silicate reservoirs on Mars; (iv) possible terrestrial loss or contamination in the noble gas signatures in new type meteorites that spent time in extreme weather conditions; (v) cosmogenic isotopes and shielding; and (vi) pseudo meteorites. We conclude that the list of candidate parent bodies for sedimentary meteorites includes, but is not limited by the Earth, Mars, Enceladus, Ganymede, Europa, and hypothetical planets that could exist between orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the past. A parent body for extraterrestrial sedimentary rocks on the Earth should be identified based on the entire body of evidence which is not limited solely by tests of oxygen and noble gas isotopes whose signatures may undergo terrestrial contamination and may exhibit significant heterogeneity within the parent bodies. Observed fall of cosmic body, evidence of hypervelocity impact complying with the criteria of impact structures, and the presence of fusion crust on the fragments should be considered as priority signs of meteoritic origin. 
The forces exerted by growing crystals on the surrounding materials play a major role in many geological processes, from diagenetic replacement to rock weathering and uplifting of rocks and soils. Although crystallization is a nonequilibrium process, the available theoretical prediction for these forces are based on equilibrium thermodynamics. Here we show that nonequilibrium effects can lead to a drop of the crystallization force in large pores where the crystal surface dissociates from the surrounding walls during growth. The critical pore size above which such detachment can be observed depends only on the ratio of kinetic coefficients and cannot be predicted from thermodynamics. Our conclusions are based on a physical model which accounts for the nonequilibrium kinetics of mass transport, and disjoining pressure effects within the thin liquid film separating the crystal and the surrounding walls. Our results suggest that the maximum size of the pores that can sustain crystallization forces close to the equilibrium prediction ranges from micrometers for salts to a millimetre for low solubility minerals such as calcite. These results are discussed in the light of recent experimental observations of the growth of confined salt crystals. 
Radar sensors are crucial for environment perception of driver assistance systems as well as autonomous vehicles. Key performance factors are weather resistance and the possibility to directly measure velocity. With a rising number of radar sensors and the so far unregulated automotive radar frequency band, mutual interference is inevitable and must be dealt with. Algorithms and models operating on radar data in early processing stages are required to run directly on specialized hardware, i.e. the radar sensor. This specialized hardware typically has strict resource-constraints, i.e. a low memory capacity and low computational power. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches for denoising and interference mitigation yield promising results for radar processing in terms of performance. However, these models typically contain millions of parameters, stored in hundreds of megabytes of memory, and require additional memory during execution. In this paper we investigate quantization techniques for CNN-based denoising and interference mitigation of radar signals. We analyze the quantization potential of different CNN-based model architectures and sizes by considering (i) quantized weights and (ii) piecewise constant activation functions, which results in reduced memory requirements for model storage and during the inference step respectively. 
The carbon-silicate cycle regulates the atmospheric $CO_2$ content of terrestrial planets on geological timescales through a balance between the rates of $CO_2$ volcanic outgassing and planetary intake from rock weathering. It is thought to act as an efficient climatic thermostat on Earth and, by extension, on other habitable planets. If, however, the weathering rate increases with the atmospheric $CO_2$ content, as expected on planets lacking land vascular plants, the carbon-silicate cycle feedback can become severely limited. Here we show that Earth-like planets receiving less sunlight than current Earth may no longer possess a stable warm climate but instead repeatedly cycle between unstable glaciated and deglaciated climatic states. This has implications for the search for life on exoplanets in the habitable zone of nearby stars. 
Boulders, rocks and regolith on fast rotating asteroids (<2.5 hours) are modeled to slide towards the equator due to a strong centrifugal force and a low cohesion force. As a result, regions of fresh subsurface material can be exposed. Therefore, we searched for color variation on small and fast rotating asteroids. We describe a novel technique in which the asteroid is simultaneously observed in the visible and near-IR wavelength range. In this technique, brightness changes due to atmospheric extinction effects can be calibrated across the visible and near-IR images. We use V- and J-band filters since the distinction in color between weathered and unweathered surfaces on ordinary chondrite-like bodies is most prominent at these wavelengths and can reach ~25%. To test our method, we observed 3 asteroids with Cerro Tololo's 1.3 m telescope. We find ~5% variation of the mean V-J color, but do not find any clearly repeating color signature through multiple rotations. This suggests that no landslides occurred within the timescale of space weathering, or that Landslides occurred but the exposed patches are too small for the measurements' uncertainty. 
Rock weathering is a common phenomenon in most engineering applications, such as underground storage or geothermal energy. This work offers a discrete element modelization of the problem considering cohesive granular material and debonding effect. Oedometer conditions are applied during the weathering and the evolution of the coefficient of lateral earth pressure, a proxy of the state of stress, is tracked. Especially, the influence of the degree of cementation, the confining pressure, the initial value of k0 and the history of load are investigated. It has been emphasized that the granular media aims to reach an attractor configuration. And the grain reorganization occurring is divided into two main phenomena: the collapse of the unstable chain forces (stable only thanks to the cementation) and the softening of the grains. 
Ecosystem-bedrock interactions power the biogeochemical cycles of Earth's shallow crust, supporting life, stimulating substrate transformation, and spurring evolutionary innovation. While oxidative processes have dominated half of terrestrial history, the relative contribution of the biosphere and its chemical fingerprints on Earth's developing regolith are still poorly constrained. Here, we report results from a two-year incipient weathering experiment. We found that the mass release and compartmentalization of major elements during weathering of granite, rhyolite, schist and basalt was rock-specific and regulated by ecosystem components.   A tight interplay between physiological needs of different biota, mineral dissolution rates, and substrate nutrient availability resulted in intricate elemental distribution patterns. Biota accelerated CO2 mineralization over abiotic controls as ecosystem complexity increased, and significantly modified stoichiometry of mobilized elements. Microbial and fungal components inhibited element leaching (23.4% and 7%), while plants increased leaching and biomass retention by 63.4%. All biota left comparable biosignatures in the dissolved weathering products. Nevertheless, the magnitude and allocation of weathered fractions under abiotic and biotic treatments provide quantitative evidence for the role of major biosphere components in the evolution of upper continental crust, presenting critical information for large-scale biogeochemical models and for the search for stable in situ biosignatures beyond Earth. 
The Neoproterozoic Earth experienced at least two global-scale glaciations termed Snowball Earth events. 'Cap carbonates' were widely deposited after the events, but controversy surrounds their origin. Here, we apply the novel $\delta^{44/40}$Ca-$\delta^{88/86}$Sr multi-proxy to two Marinoan (ca. 635 Ma) cap carbonate sequences from Namibia and show that the rocks archive primary environmental signals deriving from a combination of seawater-glacial meltwater mixing and kinetic isotope effects. In an outer platform section, dolostone $\delta^{44/40}$Ca and $\delta^{88/86}$Sr values define a line predicted for kinetic mass-dependent isotope fractionation. This dolostone mostly precipitated from meltwater. Moreover, stratigraphically higher samples exhibiting the fastest precipitation rates correlate with elevated 87Sr/86Sr ratios, consistent with long-held expectations that a rapid deglacial weathering pulse forced cap carbonate formation. An inner-platform dolostone shows greater effects from water-mass mixing but still reveals that precipitation rates increased up-section. Overlying limestones show the greatest Ca and Sr contributions from seawater. Amplification of local coastal processes during global ice sheet collapse offers a simple but sufficient proposition to explain the Ca isotope heterogeneity of cap carbonates. Detection of kinetic isotope effects in the rock record provides a basis for developing the $\delta^{44/40}$Ca-$\delta^{88/86}$Sr multi-proxy as an indicator of saturation state and $p$CO$_2$. 
The mineralogy and physical properties of Chelyabinsk meteorites (fall, February 15, 2013) are presented. Three types of meteorite material are present, described as the light-colored, dark-colored, and impact-melt lithologies. All are of LL5 composition with the impact-melt lithology being close to whole-rock melt and the dark-colored lithology being shock-darkened due to partial melting of iron metal and sulfides. This enables us to study the effect of increasing shock on material with identical composition and origin. Based on the magnetic susceptibility, the Chelyabinsk meteorites are richer in metallic iron as compared to other LL chondrites. The measured bulk and grain densities and the porosity closely resemble other LL chondrites. Shock darkening does not have a significant effect on the material physical properties, but causes a decrease of reflectance and decrease in silicate absorption bands in the reflectance spectra. This is similar to the space weathering effects observed on asteroids. However, compared to space weathered materials, there is a negligible to minor slope change observed in impact-melt and shock-darkened meteorite spectra. Thus, it is possible that some dark asteroids with invisible silicate absorption bands may be composed of relatively fresh shock-darkened chondritic material. 
In recent years, water needs increased, driven by climate change and world population growth. In this context, we study groundwater flow in the vadose zone of Beauce aquifer (O-ZNS site, France). This lacustrine limestone vadose zone is characterized by multi-scale heterogeneities. They are defined by strongly various pore structures. This leads to uncertainties for reservoir properties prediction using geophysical methods which impacts reservoir models for flow simulations.In this study, we combined microstructure description and petrophysical analysis in order to model and predict reservoir properties based on different limestones facies and to infer the influence of weathering/fracturing on both acoustics and electrical properties.A total of 16 samples from these facies were cored and characterized by their porosity, permeability, acoustic velocities, complex electrical properties and microstructure analysis.Based on our multi-method approach, we demonstrated the influence of rock structure on reservoir properties prediction and modelling. Petrophysical and microstructure characterization have highlighted two main facies (microporous and homogenous facies and macroporous and heterogenous facies) which can be used to improve reservoir and flow models. However, further development is needed in order to quantify macropores and their link with weathering and to assess permeability models using electrical properties. 
All material exposed to interplanetary space conditions are subject to degradation processes. For obvious reasons there is a great interest to study these processes for materials that are used in satellite construction. However, also the influence of particle and electromagnetic radiation on the weathering of extraterrestrial rocks and on organic and biological tissues is the research topic of various scientific disciplines. To strengthen the comprehensive and systematic investigation of degradation processes a new laboratory, the complex irradiation facility (CIF), has been designed, set up, tested, and put into operation at the DLR-Institute of Space Systems in Bremen (Germany). The CIF allows the simultaneous irradiation with three light sources and with a dual beam irradiation system for the bombardment of materials with electrons and protons having energies up to 100 keV. It is eminently suitable to perform a large variety of irradiation procedures that are similar to those which appear at different distances to the Sun. This paper is devoted to potential users in order to inform them about the capabilities of the CIF. 
Salt crystallization is a major cause of weathering of artworks, monuments and rocks. Damage will occur if crystals continue to grow in confinement, i.e. within the pore space of these materials generating mechanical stresses. We report on a novel method that allows to directly measure, at the microscale, the resulting pressure while visualizing the spontaneous nucleation and growth of alkali halide salts. The experiments reveal the crucial role of the wetting films between the growing crystal and the confining walls for the development of the pressure. The results suggest that the pressure originates from a charge repulsion between the similarly charged wall and the crystal separated by a ~1.5 nm salt solution film. Consequently, if the walls are made hydrophobic, no film and no crystallization pressure are detected. The magnitude of the pressure is system-specific and explains how a growing crystal exerts stresses at the scale of individual grains in porous materials. 
The formation of passivating films is a common aging phenomenon, for example in weathering of rocks, silicon, and metals. In many cases, a dual-layer structure with a dense inner and a porous outer layer emerges. However, the origin of this dual-layer growth is so far not fully understood. In this work, a continuum model is developed, which describes the morphology evolution of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium-ion batteries. Transport through the SEI and a growth reaction governed by the SEI surface energies are modelled. In agreement with experiments, this theory predicts that SEI grows initially as a dense film and subsequently as a porous layer. This dynamic phase transition is driven by the slowing down of electron transport as the film thickens. Thereby, the model offers a universal explanation for the emergence of dual-layer structures in passivating films. 
The movement of metals through the environment links together a wide range of scientific fields: from earth sciences and geology as weathering releases minerals; to environmental sciences as metals are mobilized and transformed, cycling through soil and water; to biology as living things take up metals from their surroundings. Studies of these fundamental processes all require quantitative analysis of metal concentrations, locations, and chemical states. Synchrotron x-ray tools can address these requirements with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and minimal sample preparation. This perspective describes the state of fundamental scientific questions in the lifecycle of metals, from rocks to ecosystems, from soils to plants, and from environment to animals. Key x-ray capabilities and facility infrastructure for future synchrotron-based analytical resources serving these areas are summarized, and potential opportunities for future experiments are explored. 
Enhanced weathering (EW) is a promising modification to current agricultural practices that uses crushed silicate rocks to drive carbon dioxide removal (CDR). If widely adopted on farmlands, it could help achieve net-zero or negative emissions by 2050. We report detailed state-level analysis indicating EW deployed on agricultural land could sequester 0.23-0.38 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$ and meet 36-60 % of U.S. technological CDR goals. Average CDR costs vary between state, being highest in the first decades before declining to a range of $\sim\$$100-150 tCO$_2{}^{-1}$ by 2050, including for three states (Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana) that contribute most to total national CDR. We identify multiple electoral swing states as being essential for scaling EW that are also key beneficiaries of the practice, indicating the need for strong bipartisan support of this technology. Assessment the geochemical capacity of rivers and oceans to carry dissolved EW products from soil drainage suggests EW provides secure long-term CO$_2$ removal on intergenerational time scales. We additionally forecast mitigation of ground-level ozone increases expected with future climate change, as an indirect benefit of EW, and consequent avoidance of yield reductions. Our assessment supports EW as a practical innovation for leveraging agriculture to enable positive action on climate change with adherence to federal environmental justice priorities. However, implementing a stage-gating framework as upscaling proceeds to safeguard against environmental and biodiversity concerns will be essential. 
Images from outdoor scenes may be taken under various weather conditions. It is well studied that weather impacts the performance of computer vision algorithms and needs to be handled properly. However, existing algorithms model weather condition as a discrete status and estimate it using multi-label classification. The fact is that, physically, specifically in meteorology, weather are modeled as a continuous and transitional status. Instead of directly implementing hard classification as existing multi-weather classification methods do, we consider the physical formulation of multi-weather conditions and model the impact of physical-related parameter on learning from the image appearance. In this paper, we start with solid revisit of the physics definition of weather and how it can be described as a continuous machine learning and computer vision task. Namely, we propose to model the weather uncertainty, where the level of probability and co-existence of multiple weather conditions are both considered. A Gaussian mixture model is used to encapsulate the weather uncertainty and a uncertainty-aware multi-weather learning scheme is proposed based on prior-posterior learning. A novel multi-weather co-presence estimation transformer (MeFormer) is proposed. In addition, a new multi-weather co-presence estimation (MePe) dataset, along with 14 fine-grained weather categories and 16,078 samples, is proposed to benchmark both conventional multi-label weather classification task and multi-weather co-presence estimation task. Large scale experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and substantial generalization capabilities on both the conventional multi-label weather classification task and the proposed multi-weather co-presence estimation task. Besides, modeling weather uncertainty also benefits adverse-weather semantic segmentation. 
For 3D geometries, we consider stones (modeled as convex polyhedra) subject to weathering with planar slices of random orientation and depth successively removing material, ultimately yielding smooth and round (i.e. spherical) shapes. An exponentially decaying acceptance probability in the area exposed by a prospective slice provides a stochastically driven physical basis for the removal of material in fracture events. With a variety of quantitative measures, in steady state we find a power law decay of deviations in a toughness parameter $\gamma$ from a perfect spherical shape. We examine the time evolution of shapes for stones initially in the form of cubes as well as irregular fragments created by cleaving a regular solid many times along random fracture planes. In the case of the former, we find two sets of second order structural phase transitions with the usual hallmarks of critical behavior. The first involves the simultaneous loss of facets original to the parent solid, while the second of these involves a shift to a spherical profile. Nevertheless, for mono-dispersed irregular solids, the loss of primordial facets is not simultaneous but occurs in stages. In the case of initially irregular stones, strong disorder obscures individual structural transitions, and relevant observables are smooth with respect to time. More broadly, we find that salient times scale quadratically in $\gamma$. We use the universal dependence of variables on the volume remaining to calculate time dependent variables for a variety of erosion scenarios with results from a single weathering scheme such as the case in which the fracture acceptance probability depends on the relative area of the prospective new face. We calculate time scales for the attainment of structural milestones, obtaining a closed form approximate expression which bounds direct simulation results from above. 
Each grid block in a 3D geological model requires a rock type that represents all physical and chemical properties of that block. The properties that classify rock types are lithology, permeability, and capillary pressure. Scientists and engineers determined these properties using conventional laboratory measurements, which embedded destructive methods to the sample or altered some of its properties (i.e., wettability, permeability, and porosity) because the measurements process includes sample crushing, fluid flow, or fluid saturation. Lately, Digital Rock Physics (DRT) has emerged to quantify these properties from micro-Computerized Tomography (uCT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. However, the literature did not attempt rock typing in a wholly digital context. We propose performing Digital Rock Typing (DRT) by: (1) integrating the latest DRP advances in a novel process that honors digital rock properties determination, while; (2) digitalizing the latest rock typing approaches in carbonate, and (3) introducing a novel carbonate rock typing process that utilizes computer vision capabilities to provide more insight about the heterogeneous carbonate rock texture. 
Although tidally-locked habitable planets orbiting nearby M-dwarf stars are among the best astronomical targets to search for extrasolar life, they may also be deficient in volatiles and water. Climate models for this class of planets show atmospheric transport of water from the dayside to the nightside, where it is precipitated as snow and trapped as ice. Since ice only slowly flows back to the dayside upon accumulation, the resulting hydrological cycle can trap a large amount of water in the form of nightside ice. Using ice sheet dynamical and thermodynamical constraints, I illustrate how planets with less than about a quarter the Earth's oceans could trap most of their surface water on the nightside. This would leave their dayside, where habitable conditions are met, potentially dry. The amount and distribution of residual liquid water on the dayside depend on a variety of geophysical factors, including the efficiency of rock weathering at regulating atmospheric CO2 as dayside ocean basins dry-up. Water-trapped worlds with dry daysides may offer similar advantages as land planets for habitability, by contrast with worlds where more abundant water freely flows around the globe. 
The article provides an open discussion and a critical feedback to the comments of Haack et al. (2015) and emphasizes a significance of the first macroscopic evidence for a candidate meteorite of a new type: planetary-origin meteorite composed of silica-rich sedimentary rock. Discussion concerns the arguments for (i) candidate parental bodies including the Earth, Mars and icy moons of Saturn and Jupiter; (ii) PGE anomaly versus glassy silicate microspherules and quartz grains anomaly in the area of the 1908 Tunguska catastrophe; (iii) isotopic heterogeneity of unmixed silicate reservoirs on Mars; (iv) possible terrestrial loss or contamination in the noble gas signatures in meteorites that spent time in the extreme weather conditions; (v) cosmogenic isotopes and shielding; and (vi) pseudo meteorites. We conclude that the list of candidate parental bodies for hypothetical sedimentary-origin meteorites includes, but is not limited by the Earth, Mars, Enceladus, Ganymede, and Europa. A parental body should be identified based on the entire body of evidence which is not limited solely by tests of oxygen and noble gas isotopes whose signatures may undergo terrestrial contamination and may exhibit significant heterogeneity within the parental bodies. 
Lakes existed on Mars later than 3.6 billion years ago, according to sedimentary evidence for deltaic deposition. The observed fluvio-lacustrine deposits suggest that individual lake-forming climates persisted for at least several thousand years (assuming dilute flow). But the lake watersheds' little weathered soils indicate a largely dry climate history, with intermittent runoff events. Here we show that these observational constraints, while inconsistent with many previously-proposed triggers for lake-forming climates, are consistent with a methane burst scenario. In this scenario, chaotic transitions in mean obliquity drive latitudinal shifts in temperature and ice loading that destabilize methane clathrate. Using numerical simulations, we find that outgassed methane can build up to atmospheric levels sufficient for lake forming climates, for past clathrate hydrate stability zone occupancy fractions >0.04. Such occupancy fractions are consistent with methane production by water-rock reactions due to hydrothermal circulation on early Mars. We further estimate that photochemical destruction of atmospheric methane curtails the duration of individual lake-forming climates to less than a million years, consistent with observations. We conclude that methane bursts represent a potential pathway for intermittent excursions to a warm, wet climate state on early Mars. 
Models of thermal evolution, crustal production, and CO$_2$ cycling are used to constrain the prospects for habitability of rocky planets, with Earth-like size and composition, in the stagnant lid regime. Specifically, we determine the conditions under which such planets can maintain rates of CO$_2$ degassing large enough to prevent global surface glaciation, but small enough so as not to exceed the upper limit on weathering rates provided by the supply of fresh rock, a situation which would lead to runaway atmospheric CO$_2$ accumulation and an inhospitably hot climate. The models show that stagnant lid planets with initial radiogenic heating rates of 100-250 TW, and with total CO$_2$ budgets ranging from $\sim 10^{-2} -1$ times Earth's estimated CO$_2$ budget, can maintain volcanic outgassing rates suitable for habitability for $\approx 1-5$ Gyrs; larger CO$_2$ budgets result in uninhabitably hot climates, while smaller budgets result in global glaciation. High radiogenic heat production rates favor habitability by sustaining volcanism and CO$_2$ outgassing longer. Thus, the results suggest that plate tectonics may not be required for establishing a long-term carbon cycle and maintaining a stable, habitable climate. The model is necessarily highly simplified, as the uncertainties with exoplanet thermal evolution and outgassing are large. Nevertheless, the results provide some first order guidance for future exoplanet missions, by predicting the age at which habitability becomes unlikely for a stagnant lid planet as a function of initial radiogenic heat budget. This prediction is powerful because both planet heat budget and age can potentially be constrained from stellar observations. 
We study reactive transport in a stressed porous media, where dissolution of the solid matrix causes two simultaneous, competing effects: pore enlargement (chemical deformation), and pore compaction due to mechanical weakening. A novel, mechanistic pore-scale model simulates flooding of a sample under fixed confining stress, showing that increasing stress inhibits permeability enhancement, increasing the injected volume required to reach a certain permeability, in agreement with recent experiments. We explain this behavior by stress concentration downstream, in the less dissolved (hence stiffer) region. As this region is also less conductive, even its small compaction has a strong bottleneck effect that curbs the permeability.   Our results also elucidate that the impact of stress depends on the dissolution regime. Under wormholing conditions (slow injection, i.e. high Damkohler, $Da$), the development of a sharp dissolution front and high porosity contrast accentuates the bottleneck effect. This reduces transport heterogeneity, promoting wormhole competition. Once the outlet starts eroding, the extreme focusing of transport and hence dissolution--characteristic of wormholing--becomes dominant, diminishing the bottleneck effect and hence the impact of stress. In contrast, at low $Da$, incomplete reaction upstream allows the reagent to traverse the sample, causing a more uniform dissolution. The continuous dissolution and its partial counteraction by compaction downstream provides a steady, gradual increase in the effect of stress. Consequently, the impact of stress is more pronounced at high $Da$ during early stages (low permeability), and at low $Da$ close to breakthrough. Our work promotes understanding of the hydromechanical property evolution, with important implications for processes ranging from diagenesis and weathering of rocks, to well stimulation and carbon geosequetration. 
A promising short term precursor of major earthquakes (EQ) is very crucial in saving people and preventing huge losses. Ez, atmospheric electrostatic field vertical component, under fair air conditions, is generally oriented downwards (positive). Anomalous negative Ez signals could be used as an indicator of a great number of radioactive gases which are released from great number of rock clefts just before major earthquakes. Enhanced emission of radon radioactive decay will produce an anomalously large number of ion pairs. The positive particles will be transported downward by the fair weather electrostatic field and pile up near the surface. Finally, obviously and abnormally, an oriented upward atmospheric electric field Ez near the ground could be formed. Therefore, monitoring this Ez may be applied effectively in earthquake warning. 
Spacecraft and ground-based observations show that the main rings of Saturn lack particles larger than 10 m. Tidal or collisional destruction of satellites/comets have been proposed as the origin of the main rings; however, Saturn's tide alone cannot grind km-sized fragments into submeter-sized particles because of the high mechanical strength of water ice and rock. The question arises as to why such large particles are not left in the current ring. It is known that thermal stress induced by diurnal and seasonal temperature variations can cause weathering and fragmentation of boulders and contribute to dust and regolith production on the Moon and terrestrial planets, and then such thermal stress can break particles larger than a critical radius while cannot smaller than the critical radius. In this study, we examined the role of thermal stress acting on Saturn's ring particles. We found that thermal stress can grind porous ring particles larger than 10-20 m, which explains the lack of particles larger than 10 m in Saturn's ring. Also, fragmentation by thermal stress can be adoptable for the Epsilon rings of Uranus. Furthermore, thermal stress caused by diurnal or seasonal temperature variation acting on boulders on surfaces of icy satellites and asteroids may play an important role in the evolution of their sizes. Our calculations explain the lack of boulders on icy satellites, except in the geologically active provinces such as the tiger stripes of Enceladus, where boulders are supplied by recent geological activity. We predict that future observations can find numerous boulders around Europa's geologically active cracks. 
The extraordinary weather conditions available between February and March 2022 over Spain have allowed us to analyze the brightest fireballs recorded by the monitoring stations of the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN). We study the atmospheric flight of 15 large meteoroids to determine if they are meteorite dropper events to prepare campaigns to search for freshly fallen extraterrestrial material. We investigate their origins in the Solar System and their dynamic association with parent bodies and meteoroid streams. Employing our Python pipeline 3D-FireTOC, we reconstruct the atmospheric trajectory utilizing ground-based multi-station observations and compute the heliocentric orbit. In addition, we apply an ablation model to estimate the initial and terminal mass of each event. Using a dissimilarity criterion and propagating backward in time, we check the connection of these meteoroids with known complexes and near-Earth objects. We also calculate if the orbits are compatible with recent meteoroid ejections. We find that ~27% of these fireballs are dynamically associated with minor meteoroid streams and exhibit physical properties of cometary bodies, as well as one associated with a near-Earth asteroid. We identify two meteorite-producing events; however, the on-site search was unsuccessful. By considering that these fireballs are mostly produced by cm-sized rocks that might be the fragmentation product of much larger meteoroids, our findings emphasize the idea that the population of near-Earth objects is a source of near-term impact hazards, existing large Earth-colliding meteoroids in the known complexes. 
A multi-step steady-state (MSSS) method is proposed here for the measurement of low permeability. This new method can accurately and easily measure very low permeabilities of rock samples using a new setup, where the targeted rock sample and ordinary apparatus components are connected with a reference rock sample to form a series circuit. Any conventional rock sample with high permeability could be used as a reference rock sample such that the traditional steady-state measurement is feasible to accurately determine its permeability as a reference value in the MSSS method. The challenging measurement of tiny mass flux rate by advanced pump system is avoided and the permeability of targeted rock sample can be directly computed using the pressure drops, sectional areas and lengths of the two connected rock samples, and the known permeability of the reference rock sample, based on the mass conservation principle in a series circuit at steady state. Multi-step measurements using additional reference rock samples will be needed if the pressure drop across the first reference rock sample is too small to be accurately measured due to high permeability ratio when it is connected with the targeted rock sample to form a series circuit. The relative pressure drops can be small since the measurement of flow speed is unnecessary, which improves the accuracy in studying the dependence of gas permeability on the pore pressure. Consequently, the advantages of the MSSS method include low expense, simplicity, high accuracy and efficiency. 
It is well known that sedimentary rocks having same porosity can have very different pore size distribution. The pore distribution determines many characteristics of the rock among which, its transport property is often the most useful. Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool that is increasingly used to characterize the pore space. In this study we have done multifractal analysis of pore distribution on sedimentary rocks simulated using the Relaxed Bidisperse Ballistic Model (RBBDM). The RBBDM can generate a $3-D$ structure of sedimentary rocks of variable porosity by tuning the fraction $p$ of particles of two different sizes. We have also done multifractal analysis on two samples of real sedimentary rock to compare with the simulation studies. One sample, an oolitic limestone is of high porosity (40%)while the other is a reefal carbonate of low porosity around 7%. $2-D$ sections of X-ray micro-tomographs of the real rocks were stacked sequentially to reconstruct the real rock specimens. Both samples show a multifractal character, but we show that RBBDM gives a very realistic representation of a typical high porosity sedimentary rock. 
We apply a deep learning model to segment and identify rock characteristics based on a Structure-from-Motion orthomap and digital elevation model of a rocky fault scarp in the Volcanic Tablelands, eastern California. By post-processing the deep learning results, we build a semantic rock map and analyze rock trait distributions. The resulting semantic map contains nearly 230,000 rocks with effective diameters ranging from 2 cm to 250 cm. Rock trait distributions provide a new perspective on rocky fault scarp development and extend past research on scarp geometry including slope, height, and length. Heatmaps indicate rock size spatial distributions on the fault scarp and surrounding topographic flats. Median grain size changes perpendicular to the fault scarp trace with the largest rocks exposed on and downslope from the scarp footwall. Correlation analyses of the segmented fault scarp illustrate the relationship between rock trait statistics and fault scarp geomorphology. Local fault scarp height correlates with median grain size (R2 of 0.6), the mean grain size of the largest rocks (R2 of 0.76), and the ratio of the number of small to large rocks (R2 of 0.40). The positive correlation (R2 of 0.81) between local fault scarp height and standard deviation of grain size suggests that rocks on a higher fault scarp are less well sorted. The correlation analysis between fault scarp height and rock orientation statistics supports a particle transportation model in which locally higher fault scarps have relatively more rocks with long axes parallel to fault scarp trace because rocks have a larger distance to roll and orient the long axes. Our work demonstrates a data-driven approach to geomorphology based on rock trait distributions, promising a greater understanding of fault scarp formation, as well as many other applications for which granulometry is an indicator of process. 
In this paper, a new task is proposed, namely, weather translation, which refers to transferring weather conditions of the image from one category to another. It is important for photographic style transfer. Although lots of approaches have been proposed in traditional image translation tasks, few of them can handle the multi-category weather translation task, since weather conditions have rich categories and highly complex semantic structures. To address this problem, we develop a multi-domain weather translation approach based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), denoted as Weather GAN, which can achieve the transferring of weather conditions among sunny, cloudy, foggy, rainy and snowy. Specifically, the weather conditions in the image are determined by various weather-cues, such as cloud, blue sky, wet ground, etc. Therefore, it is essential for weather translation to focus the main attention on weather-cues. To this end, the generator of Weather GAN is composed of an initial translation module, an attention module and a weather-cue segmentation module. The initial translation module performs global translation during generation procedure. The weather-cue segmentation module identifies the structure and exact distribution of weather-cues. The attention module learns to focus on the interesting areas of the image while keeping other areas unaltered. The final generated result is synthesized by these three parts. This approach suppresses the distortion and deformation caused by weather translation. our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts has been shown by a large number of experiments and evaluations. 
Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed to remove adverse weather conditions in single images using a single set of pre-trained weights, they fail to restore weather videos due to the absence of temporal information. Furthermore, existing methods for removing adverse weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, and snow) from videos can only handle one type of adverse weather. In this work, we propose the first framework for restoring videos from all adverse weather conditions by developing a video adverse-weather-component suppression network (ViWS-Net). To achieve this, we first devise a weather-agnostic video transformer encoder with multiple transformer stages. Moreover, we design a long short-term temporal modeling mechanism for weather messenger to early fuse input adjacent video frames and learn weather-specific information. We further introduce a weather discriminator with gradient reversion, to maintain the weather-invariant common information and suppress the weather-specific information in pixel features, by adversarially predicting weather types. Finally, we develop a messenger-driven video transformer decoder to retrieve the residual weather-specific feature, which is spatiotemporally aggregated with hierarchical pixel features and refined to predict the clean target frame of input videos. Experimental results, on benchmark datasets and real-world weather videos, demonstrate that our ViWS-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of restoring videos degraded by any weather condition. 
The study of the weather is performed using instruments termed weather stations. These weather stations are distributed around the world, collecting the data from the different phenomena. Several weather organizations have been deploying thousands of these instruments, creating big networks to collect weather data. These instruments are collecting the weather data and delivering it for later processing in the collections points. Nevertheless, all the methodologies used to transmit the weather data are based in protocols non adapted for this purpose. Thus, the weather stations are limited by the data formats and protocols used in them, not taking advantage of the real-time data available on them. We research the weather instruments, their technology and their network capabilities, in order to provide a solution for the mentioned problem. OpenWeather is the protocol proposed to provide a more optimum and reliable way to transmit the weather data. We evaluate the environmental factors, such as location or bandwidth availability, in order to design a protocol adapted to the requirements established by the automatic weather stations. A peer to peer architecture is proposed, providing a functional implementation of OpenWeather protocol. The evaluation of the protocol is executed in a real scenario, providing the hints to adapt the protocol to a common automatic weather station. 
This work investigates the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology for measurement of rock fragmentation without placement of scale objects in the scene to determine image scale. Commonly practiced image-based rock fragmentation analysis requires a technician to walk to a rock pile, place a scale object of known size in the area of interest, and capture individual 2D images. Our previous work has used UAV technology for the first time to acquire real-time rock fragmentation data and has shown comparable quality of results; however, it still required the (potentially dangerous) placement of scale objects, and continued to make the assumption that the rock pile surface is planar and that the scale objects lie on the surface plane. This work improves our UAV-based approach to enable rock fragmentation measurement without placement of scale objects and without the assumption of planarity. This is achieved by first generating a point cloud of the rock pile from 2D images, taking into account intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, and then taking 2D images for fragmentation analysis. This work represents an important step towards automating post-blast rock fragmentation analysis. In experiments, a rock pile with known size distribution was photographed by the UAV with and without using scale objects. For fragmentation analysis without scale objects, a point cloud of the rock pile was generated and used to compute image scale. Comparison of the rock size distributions show that this point-cloud-based method enables producing measurements with better or comparable accuracy (within 10% of the ground truth) to the manual method with scale objects. 
Uncertainty is ubiquitous with flow in subsurface rocks because of their inherent heterogeneity and lack of in-situ measurements. To complete uncertainty analysis in a multi-scale manner, it is a prerequisite to provide sufficient rock samples. Even though the advent of digital rock technology offers opportunities to reproduce rocks, it still cannot be utilized to provide massive samples due to its high cost, thus leading to the development of diversified mathematical methods. Among them, two-point statistics (TPS) and multi-point statistics (MPS) are commonly utilized, which feature incorporating low-order and high-order statistical information, respectively. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are becoming increasingly popular since they can reproduce training images with excellent visual and consequent geologic realism. However, standard GANs can only incorporate information from data, while leaving no interface for user-defined properties, and thus may limit the representativeness of reconstructed samples. In this study, we propose conditional GANs for digital rock reconstruction, aiming to reproduce samples not only similar to the real training data, but also satisfying user-specified properties. In fact, the proposed framework can realize the targets of MPS and TPS simultaneously by incorporating high-order information directly from rock images with the GANs scheme, while preserving low-order counterparts through conditioning. We conduct three reconstruction experiments, and the results demonstrate that rock type, rock porosity, and correlation length can be successfully conditioned to affect the reconstructed rock images. Furthermore, in contrast to existing GANs, the proposed conditioning enables learning of multiple rock types simultaneously, and thus invisibly saves computational cost. 
The concept of joint persistence has been widely used to study the mechanics and failure processes of rock masses benefitting from the simplicity of statistical linear weighing of the discontinuity. Nevertheless, this term neglects the scale effects of rock bridges, meaning that the same joint persistence may refer to different numbers and spacings of rock bridges, leading to erroneous equivalent rock mass responses. To fill in this gap, an intact rock bridge was dispersed as multi rock bridges while maintaining a constant joint persistence, subjected to direct shear by conducting numerical simulations employing Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC). In this way, scale effects of rock bridges were investigated from the perspective of load-displacement curves, stress and displacement fields, crack propagations and AE characterizations. Results revealed that the shear resistance and the area and value of stress-concentration decreased with increasing dispersion. Furthermore, uneven distribution of displacement fields in an arc manner moving and degrading away from the load was first observed, indicating the sequential failure of multi rock bridges. It was also found that the propagation of wing cracks was insensitive to scale, while the asperity of macro shear fracture mainly formed by secondary cracks decreased with increasing dispersion. In addition, increasing dispersion of rock bridges would overlap the failure precursors identified by intense AE activities. Based on the abovementioned results, we evaluated existing methods to characterize the joint persistence, and a threshold was observed to possibly define a rock bridge. 
Accurate image segmentation is crucial in reservoir modelling and material characterization, enhancing oil and gas extraction efficiency through detailed reservoir models. This precision offers insights into rock properties, advancing digital rock physics understanding. However, creating pixel-level annotations for complex CT and SEM rock images is challenging due to their size and low contrast, lengthening analysis time. This has spurred interest in advanced semi-supervised and unsupervised segmentation techniques in digital rock image analysis, promising more efficient, accurate, and less labour-intensive methods. Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) revolutionized image segmentation in 2023, offering interactive and automated segmentation with zero-shot capabilities, essential for digital rock physics with limited training data and complex image features. Despite its advanced features, SAM struggles with rock CT/SEM images due to their absence in its training set and the low-contrast nature of grayscale images. Our research fine-tunes SAM for rock CT/SEM image segmentation, optimizing parameters and handling large-scale images to improve accuracy. Experiments on rock CT and SEM images show that fine-tuning significantly enhances SAM's performance, enabling high-quality mask generation in digital rock image analysis. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the fine-tuned SAM model (RockSAM) for rock images, offering segmentation without extensive training or complex labelling. 
Rocking rigid bodies appear in several shapes in everyday life: As furniture like rocking chairs and rocking cradles or as toys like rocking horses or tilting dolls. The familiar rocking motion of these objects, a non-linear combination of a rigid rotation and a translation of the center of mass, gives rise to a number of interesting dynamical properties. However, their study has received little attention in the literature.   This work presents a comprehensive introduction to the dynamics of rocking rigid bodies, including a concise derivation of the equations of motion as well as a general inversion procedure to construct rocking rigid body shapes with specified dynamical properties. Moreover, two novel rigid body shapes are derived - the tautochrone shape and the brachistochrone shape - which represent an intriguing generalization of the well-know tautochrone and brachistochrone curves. In particular, tautochrone shapes offer an alternative construction of a tautochrone pendulum, in addition to Huygens' cycloid pendulum solution. 
This paper studies the dynamics of an elastic single degree of freedom oscillator (representing an elastic frame) coupled with a rocking wall. Two types of rocking walls namely stepping rocking wall and pinned rocking wall are presented and analyzed. For each case, full nonlinear equations of motions are calculated. The dynamic behavior of the systems shows mixed results in suppressing the dynamic response of the elastic oscillator. Through comprehensive analysis, pinned rocking wall amplifies the displacement along wide range of the spectrum, in the other hand, stepping rocking wall is the most effective especially in relatively flexible structures and with a heavier wall. This is mainly because of the pinned wall's mass works against its stability. In this study, a simple, oscillator-rocking-wall model is defined and analyzed using OpenSees and, the results from OpenSees shows a good agreement with equation of motion solution using MATLAB. 
The efficiency of thermal pressurisation as a dynamic weakening mechanism relies on the thermal and hydraulic properties of the rocks forming the fault core. Here, we assess the effectiveness of thermal pressurisation by comparing predictions of temperature rise to field estimates based on pseudotachylyte-bearing rocks. We measure hydraulic and transport properties of a suite of fault rocks (a healed cataclasite, an unhealed breccia and the intact parent rock) from the pseudotachylyte-bearing Gole Larghe fault in the Adamello batholith (Italy), and use them as inputs in numerical simulations of thermal pressurisation. We find that the melting temperature can be reached only if damaged, unhealed rock properties are used. A tenfold increase in permeability, or a fourfold increase in pore compressibility of the intact rock is required to achieve melting. Our results emphasise the importance of damage processes that strongly modify fault rock properties and dynamic weakening processes during earthquake propagation. 
The efficiency of regolith production is key in understanding the properties of airless surfaces. Debris aprons, of fillets, around rocks are an ubiquitous morphology on many surfaces without atmosphere, which origin and evolution are largely unknown. Here we show that fillet originates from the juxtaposed rock under abrasion and that rocks of different cohesion have fillets with distinct morphological evolution. Thus, a fillet around a rock allows to disentangle rock cohesion from its surface exposure age. By combing topographic diffusion modeling with images of blocks of known age on the Moon we find abrasion rates for cm-sized boulders similar to regional rates (0.2 mm/Myr), whereas for 10-m sized blocks the rate is two order of magnitude higher (20 mm/Myr). Rates for instances of rocks of higher strength are reduced by ~50%. Fillets around lunar rocks are consistent with abrasion by isotropic micrometeoroid bombardment. 
Pressurized fluid injection into underground rocks occurs in applications like carbon sequestration, hydraulic fracturing, and wastewater disposal, and may lead to human-induced earthquakes and surface uplift. The fluid injection raises the pore pressure within the porous rocks, while deforming them, yet this coupling is not well understood as experimental studies of rocks are usually limited to postmortem inspection and cannot capture the complete deformation process in time and space. We investigate injection-induced deformation of a unique rock-like transparent medium mimicking the deformation of sandstone, yet under low pressure. By incorporating within this artificial rock fluorescent microspheres we capture its internal deformation in real time during the pressurized flow. We then modify the theory of poroelasticity to model accurately and without any fitting parameters the internal elastic deformations, hence providing a physical mechanism for the process. Moreover, our results demonstrate and validate the underling assumptions of the poroelastic theory for fluid injection in rock-like materials. Our results are relevant for understanding human-induced earthquakes and injection induced surface uplift, as they decouple the role of the pressurized flow from the rock deformation through the poroelastic theory. 
One of the interesting features with the ellipsoidal models of anisotropy presented in this paper is their acceptance of analytical solutions for some of the basic elasticity problems. It was shown by Pouya (2000) and Pouya and Zaoui (2006) that many closed-form solutions for basic problems involving linear isotropic materials could be extended by linear transformation to cover a variety of "ellipsoidal" materials. This paper will describe two main varieties of ellipsoidal elastic models and show how well they fit the in situ data for sedimentary rocks; numerical homogenization results for several varieties of fractured rock masses will also be provided. 
A general-purpose model combining concepts from rational continuum mechanics, fracture and damage mechanics, plasticity, and poromechanics is devised in Eulerian coordinates, involving objective time derivatives. The model complies with mass, momentum, and energy conservation as well as entropy inequality and objectivity. It is devised to cover many diverse phenomena, specifically rupture of existing lithospheric faults, tectonic earthquakes, generation and propagation of seismic waves, birth of new tectonic faults, or volcanic activity, aseismic creep, folding of rocks, aging of rocks, long-distance saturated water transport and flow in poroelastic rocks, melting of rocks and formation of magma chambers, or solidification of magma. 
The Mars Perseverance rover applies computer vision for navigation and hazard avoidance. The challenge to do onboard object recognition highlights the need for low-power, customized training, often including low-contrast backgrounds. We investigate deep learning methods for the classification and detection of Martian rocks. We report greater than 97% accuracy for binary classifications (rock vs. rover). We fine-tune a detector to render geo-located bounding boxes while counting rocks. For these models to run on microcontrollers, we shrink and quantize the neural networks' weights and demonstrate a low-power rock hunter with faster frame rates (1 frame per second) but lower accuracy (37%). 
The TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison (THAI) is a community project that aims to quantify how dfferences in general circulation models (GCMs) could impact the climate prediction for TRAPPIST-1e and, subsequently its atmospheric characterization in transit. Four GCMs have participated in THAI so far: ExoCAM, LMD-Generic, ROCKE-3D and the UM. This paper, focused on the simulated observations, is the third part of a trilogy, following the analysis of two land planet scenarios (part I) and two aquaplanet scenarios (part II). Here, we show a robust agreement between the simulated spectra and the number of transits estimated to detect the land planet atmospheres. For the aquaplanet ones, using atmospheric data from any of the four GCMs would require at least 17 transits. This prediction corresponds to UM simulated data which produces the lowest and thinnest clouds. Between 35-40% more clouds are predicted by ExoCAM or LMD-G due to higher thick terminator clouds. For the first time this work provides "GCM uncertainty error bars" of 35-40% that need to be considered in future analyses of transmission spectra. We also analyzed the inter-transit variability induced by weather patterns and changes of terminator cloudiness between transits. Its magnitude differs significantly between the GCMs but its impact on the transmission spectra is within the measurement uncertainties. THAI has demonstrated the importance of model intercomparison for exoplanets and also paved the way for a larger project to develop an intercomparison meta-framework, namely the Climates Using Interactive Suites of Intercomparisons Nested for Exoplanet Studies (CUISINES). 
Replacement reactions during fluid infiltration into porous media, rocks and buildings are known to have important implications for reservoir development, ore formation as well as weathering. Natural observations and experiments have shown that in such systems the shape of reaction fronts can vary significantly ranging from smooth, rough to highly irregular. It remains unclear what process-related knowledge can be derived from these reaction front patterns. In this contribution we show a numerical approach to test the effect of relative rates of advection, diffusion and reaction on the development of reaction fronts patterns in granular aggregates with permeable grain boundaries. The numerical model takes (i) fluid infiltration along permeable grain boundaries, (ii) reactions and (iii) elemental diffusion into account. We monitor the change in element concentration within the fluid, while reactions occur at a pre-defined rate as a function of the local fluid concentration. In non-dimensional phase space using P{\'e}clet and Damk{\"o}hler numbers, results show that there are no rough fronts without advection (P{\'e}clet<70) nor if the reaction is too fast (Damk{\"o}hler>10-3). As advection becomes more dominant and reaction slower, roughness develops across several grains with a full microstructure mimicking replacement in the most extreme cases. The reaction front patterns show an increase in roughness with increasing P{\'e}clet number from P{\'e}clet 10 to 100 but then a decrease in roughness towards higher P{\'e}clet numbers controlled by the Damk{\"o}hler number. Our results indicate that reaction rates are crucial for pattern formation and that the shape of reaction fronts is only partly due to the underlying transport mechanism. 
This study is part of an effort to build a mid-infrared database (7-14micron) of spectra for MERTIS (Mercury Radiometer and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer), an instrument onboard of the ESA/JAXA BepiColombo space probe to be launched to Mercury in 2017. Mercury was exposed to abundant impacts throughout its history. This study of terrestrial impactites can provide estimates of the effects of shock metamorphism on the mid-infrared spectral properties of planetary materials. In this study, we focus on the Noerdlinger Ries crater in Southern Germany, a well preserved and easily accessible impact crater with abundant suevite impactites. Suevite and melt glass bulk samples from Otting and Aumuehle, as well as red suevite from Polsingen were characterized and their reflectance spectra in mid-infrared range obtained. In addition, in-situ mid-infrared spectra were made from glasses and matrix areas in thin sections. The results show similar, but distinguishable spectra for both bulk suevite and melt glass samples, as well as in-situ measurements. Impact melt glass from Aumuehle and Otting have spectra dominated by a Reststrahlen band at 9.3-9.6 micron. Bulk melt rock from Polsingen and bulk suevite and fine-grained matrix have their strongest band between 9.4 to 9.6 micron. There are also features between 8.5 and 9 micron, and 12.5 - 12.8 micron associated with crystalline phases. There is evidence of weathering products in the fine-grained matrix, such as smectites. Mercury endured many impacts with impactors of all sizes over its history. So spectral characteristics observed for impactites formed only in a single impact like in the Ries impact event can be expected to be very common on planetary bodies exposed to many more impacts in their past. We conclude that in mid-infrared remote sensing data the surface of Mercury can be expected to be dominated by features of amorphous materials. 
In autonomous driving scenarios, current object detection models show strong performance when tested in clear weather. However, their performance deteriorates significantly when tested in degrading weather conditions. In addition, even when adapted to perform robustly in a sequence of different weather conditions, they are often unable to perform well in all of them and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To efficiently mitigate forgetting, we propose Domain-Incremental Learning through Activation Matching (DILAM), which employs unsupervised feature alignment to adapt only the affine parameters of a clear weather pre-trained network to different weather conditions. We propose to store these affine parameters as a memory bank for each weather condition and plug-in their weather-specific parameters during driving (i.e. test time) when the respective weather conditions are encountered. Our memory bank is extremely lightweight, since affine parameters account for less than 2% of a typical object detector. Furthermore, contrary to previous domain-incremental learning approaches, we do not require the weather label when testing and propose to automatically infer the weather condition by a majority voting linear classifier. 
Despite the success of deep learning-based object detection methods in recent years, it is still challenging to make the object detector reliable in adverse weather conditions such as rain and snow. For the robust performance of object detectors, unsupervised domain adaptation has been utilized to adapt the detection network trained on clear weather images to adverse weather images. While previous methods do not explicitly address weather corruption during adaptation, the domain gap between clear and adverse weather can be decomposed into two factors with distinct characteristics: a style gap and a weather gap. In this paper, we present an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for object detection that can more effectively adapt to real-world environments with adverse weather conditions by addressing these two gaps separately. Our method resolves the style gap by concentrating on style-related information of high-level features using an attention module. Using self-supervised contrastive learning, our framework then reduces the weather gap and acquires instance features that are robust to weather corruption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods for object detection in adverse weather conditions. 
Recently, the rock mechanical and rock engineering designs and calculations are frequently based on Geological Strength Index (GSI) method, because it is the only system that provides a complete set of mechanical properties for design purpose. Both the failure criteria and the deformation moduli of the rock mass can be calculated with GSI based equations, which consists of the disturbance factor, as well. The aim of this paper is the sensitivity analysis of GSI and disturbance factor dependent equations that characterize the mechanical properties of rock masses. The survey of the GSI system is not our purpose. The results show that the rock mass strength calculated by the Hoek-Brown failure criteria and both the Hoek-Diederichs and modified Hoek-Diederichs deformation moduli are highly sensitive to changes of both the GSI and the D factor, hence their exact determination is important for the rock engineering design. 
Google Earth (GE) has become a powerful tool for geological modeling and visualization. An interesting and useful feature of GE, Google Street View, can allow the GE users to view geological structure such as layers of rock masses at a field site. In this paper, we introduce a practical solution for building 3D geological models for rock masses based on the data acquired by use with GE. A real study case at Haut-Barr, France is presented to demonstrate our solution. We first locate the position of Haut-Barr in GE, and then determine the shape and scale of the rock masses in the study area, and thirdly acquire the layout of layers of rock masses in the Google Street View, and finally create the approximate 3D geological models by extruding and intersecting. The generated 3D geological models can simply reflect the basic structure of the rock masses at Haut-Barr, and can be used for visualizing the rock bodies interactively. 
We here analyze the propagation of transients of fluid-rock temperature and pressure through a thin boundary layer, where a steady trend is present, between two adjacent homogeneous rocks. We focus on the effect of convection on transients crossing such thin layer. In comparison with early models where this boundary was assumed a sharp mathematical plane separating the two rocks, here we show a realistic analysis of such boundary layer that implies a novel nonlinear model. Its solutions describe large amplitude, quick and sharp transients characterized by a novel drift and variations of the signal amplitude, leading to a nonlinear wave propagation. Possible applications are in volcanic, hydrologic, hydrothermal systems as well as for deep oil drilling. In addition, this formalism could easily be generalized for the case of a signal arriving in a rock characterized by a steady trend of pressure and/or temperature. These effects, being proportional to the initial conditions, can also give velocity variations not particularly important. A further heuristic model has therefore been analyzed, i.e. assuming a pressure dependent rock permeability. In this way, a remarkable increase of the system velocities is obtained. 
The Iberian Mediterranean Basin is home to one of the largest groups of prehistoric rock art sites in Europe. Despite the cultural relevance of prehistoric Spanish Levantine rock art, pigment composition remains partially unknown, and the nature of the binders used for painting has yet to be disclosed. In this work, we present the first omic analysis applied to one of the flagship Levantine rock art sites: the Valltorta ravine (Castell{\'o}n, Spain). We used high-throughput sequencing to provide the first description of the bacterial communities colonizing the rock art patina, which proved to be dominated by Firmicutes species and might have a protective effect on the paintings. Proteomic analysis was also performed on rock art microsamples in order to determine the organic binders present in Levantine prehistoric rock art pigments. This information could shed light on the controversial dating of this UNESCO Cultural Heritage, and contribute to defining the chrono-cultural framework of the societies responsible for these paintings. 
A coupled mech-hydro-chemical model for rock geometry alteration of fractures under water-rock interaction (WRI) and geostress is developed. Processes including WRI, asperity deformation, mineral chemical dissolution and pressure dissolution etc., are taken into account. A feature of this model lies in its approximate linearization to the non-linear pressure dissolution process, which makes this model compatible with existing numerical solute transport models. Case study shows that although usually only a thin layer of rock surface is invaded by WRI, the mechanical weakening of this thin layer tend to induce significant increase in rock surface deformation. Thus, the distributed flow field, mineral dissolution rates, and surface alteration increments etc., are all affected. This indicates that when fracture flow related issues are concerned, we should focus on the top thin layer of rock surface rather than the matrix. Results also show that fluid flow enhances the dissolution of rocks and development of flowing channels; however, at places where stress induces high pressure-dissolution but fluid flows slowly, minerals precipitate and fill up fracture voids. This suggests the hydraulic condition plays a key role in the development of fracture flow channels and the evolution of fracture geometry. 
This paper investigates the inelastic response of a yielding structure coupled with a rocking wall which can be vertically restrained. The paper first derives the nonlinear equations of motion of a yielding oscillator coupled with a vertically restrained rocking wall and the dependability of the one-degree of freedom idealization is validated against the nonlinear time-history response analysis of a well-known 9-story moment-resisting steel frame that is coupled with a stepping rocking wall. While, the coupling of weak building frames with rocking walls is an efficient strategy that controls inelastic deformations by enforcing a uniform interstory-drift distribution, therefore, avoiding mid-story failures, the paper shows that even for medium-rise buildings the effect of vertical tendons on the inelastic structural response is marginal, with the exception of increasing the vertical reactions at the pivoting points of the rocking wall. Accordingly, the paper, concludes that for medium- to high-rise buildings vertical tendons in rocking walls are not beneficial. 
This study presents a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based approach for predicting the effective elastic moduli of rocks from their digital CT-scan images. We use the Mapper algorithm to transform 3D digital rock images into graph datasets, encapsulating essential geometrical information. These graphs, after training, prove effective in predicting elastic moduli. Our GNN model shows robust predictive capabilities across various graph sizes derived from various subcube dimensions. Not only does it perform well on the test dataset, but it also maintains high prediction accuracy for unseen rocks and unexplored subcube sizes. Comparative analysis with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) reveals the superior performance of GNNs in predicting unseen rock properties. Moreover, the graph representation of microstructures significantly reduces GPU memory requirements (compared to the grid representation for CNNs), enabling greater flexibility in the batch size selection. This work demonstrates the potential of GNN models in enhancing the prediction accuracy of rock properties and boosting the efficiency of digital rock analysis. 
Weather Recognition plays an important role in our daily lives and many computer vision applications. However, recognizing the weather conditions from a single image remains challenging and has not been studied thoroughly. Generally, most previous works treat weather recognition as a single-label classification task, namely, determining whether an image belongs to a specific weather class or not. This treatment is not always appropriate, since more than one weather conditions may appear simultaneously in a single image. To address this problem, we make the first attempt to view weather recognition as a multi-label classification task, i.e., assigning an image more than one labels according to the displayed weather conditions. Specifically, a CNN-RNN based multi-label classification approach is proposed in this paper. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is extended with a channel-wise attention model to extract the most correlated visual features. The Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) further processes the features and excavates the dependencies among weather classes. Finally, the weather labels are predicted step by step. Besides, we construct two datasets for the weather recognition task and explore the relationships among different weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The new constructed datasets will be available at https://github.com/wzgwzg/Multi-Label-Weather-Recognition. 
Random reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) digital rocks from two-dimensional (2D) slices is crucial for elucidating the microstructure of rocks and its effects on pore-scale flow in terms of numerical modeling, since massive samples are usually required to handle intrinsic uncertainties. Despite remarkable advances achieved by traditional process-based methods, statistical approaches and recently famous deep learning-based models, few works have focused on producing several kinds of rocks with one trained model and allowing the reconstructed samples to satisfy certain given properties, such as porosity. To fill this gap, we propose a new framework, named RockGPT, which is composed of VQ-VAE and conditional GPT, to synthesize 3D samples based on a single 2D slice from the perspective of video generation. The VQ-VAE is utilized to compress high-dimensional input video, i.e., the sequence of continuous rock slices, to discrete latent codes and reconstruct them. In order to obtain diverse reconstructions, the discrete latent codes are modeled using conditional GPT in an autoregressive manner, while incorporating conditional information from a given slice, rock type, and porosity. We conduct two experiments on five kinds of rocks, and the results demonstrate that RockGPT can produce different kinds of rocks with the same model, and the reconstructed samples can successfully meet certain specified porosities. In a broader sense, through leveraging the proposed conditioning scheme, RockGPT constitutes an effective way to build a general model to produce multiple kinds of rocks simultaneously that also satisfy user-defined properties. 
Saturn's rings are rock-poor, containing 90%-95% ice by mass. As a group, Saturn's moons interior to and including Tethys are also about 90% ice. Tethys itself contains <6% rock by mass, in contrast to its similar-mass outer neighbor Dione, which contains >40% rock. Here we simulate the evolution of a massive primordial ice-rich ring and the production of satellites as ring material spreads beyond the Roche limit. We describe the Roche-interior ring with an analytic model, and use an N-body code to describe material beyond the Roche limit. We track the accretion and interactions of spawned satellites, including tidal interaction with the planet, assuming a tidal dissipation factor for Saturn of $Q~10^4$. We find that ring torques and capture of moons into mutual resonances produce a system of ice-rich inner moons that extends outward to approximately Tethys's orbit in $10^9$ years, even with relatively slow orbital expansion due to tides. The resulting mass and semimajor axis distribution of spawned moons resembles that of Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys. We estimate the mass of rock delivered to the moons by external cometary impactors during a late heavy bombardment. We find that the inner moons receive a mass in rock comparable to their current total rock content, while Dione and Rhea receive an order-of-magnitude less rock than their current rock content. This suggests that external ontamination may have been the primary source of rock in the inner moons, and that Dione and Rhea formed from much more rock-rich source material. Reproducing the distribution of rock among the current inner moons is challenging, and appears to require large impactors stochasticity and/or the presence of some rock in the initial ring. 
Adverse weather removal tasks like deraining, desnowing, and dehazing are usually treated as separate tasks. However, in practical autonomous driving scenarios, the type, intensity,and mixing degree of weather are unknown, so handling each task separately cannot deal with the complex practical scenarios. In this paper, we study the blind adverse weather removal problem. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a popular model that adopts a learnable gate to route the input to different expert networks. The principle of MoE involves using adaptive networks to process different types of unknown inputs. Therefore, MoE has great potential for blind adverse weather removal. However, the original MoE module is inadequate for coupled multiple weather types and fails to utilize multi-scale features for better performance. To this end, we propose a method called Weather-aware Multi-scale MoE (WM-MoE) based on Transformer for blind weather removal. WM-MoE includes two key designs: WEather-Aware Router (WEAR) and Multi-Scale Experts (MSE). WEAR assigns experts for each image token based on decoupled content and weather features, which enhances the model's capability to process multiple adverse weathers. To obtain discriminative weather features from images, we propose Weather Guidance Fine-grained Contrastive Learning (WGF-CL), which utilizes weather cluster information to guide the assignment of positive and negative samples for each image token. Since processing different weather types requires different receptive fields, MSE leverages multi-scale features to enhance the spatial relationship modeling capability, facilitating the high-quality restoration of diverse weather types and intensities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in blind adverse weather removal on two public datasets and our dataset. We also demonstrate the advantage of our method on downstream segmentation tasks. 
The rapidly shrinking Arctic sea ice is changing weather patterns and disrupting the balance of nature. Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV) plays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme weather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic regions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still unknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically evaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within and around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at the intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily Arctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming climate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather patterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk to human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate climate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and implies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather instabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of Arctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a fresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic. 
Real-world weather conditions are intricate and often occur concurrently. However, most existing restoration approaches are limited in their applicability to specific weather conditions in training data and struggle to generalize to unseen weather types, including real-world weather conditions.To address this issue, we introduce MetaWeather, a universal approach that can handle diverse and novel weather conditions with a single unified model. Extending a powerful meta-learning framework, MetaWeather formulates the task of weather-degraded image restoration as a few-shot adaptation problem that predicts the degradation pattern of a query image, and learns to adapt to unseen weather conditions through a novel spatial-channel matching algorithm. Experimental results on the BID Task II.A, SPA-Data, and RealSnow datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can adapt to unseen weather conditions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-weather image restoration methods. 
All-in-one adverse weather removal is an emerging topic on image restoration, which aims to restore multiple weather degradations in an unified model, and the challenge are twofold. First, discover and handle the property of multi-domain in target distribution formed by multiple weather conditions. Second, design efficient and effective operations for different degradations. To resolve this problem, most prior works focus on the multi-domain caused by different weather types. Inspired by inter\&intra-domain adaptation literature, we observe that not only weather type but also weather severity introduce multi-domain within each weather type domain, which is ignored by previous methods, and further limit their performance. To this end, we propose a degradation type and severity aware model, called UtilityIR, for blind all-in-one bad weather image restoration. To extract weather information from single image, we propose a novel Marginal Quality Ranking Loss (MQRL) and utilize Contrastive Loss (CL) to guide weather severity and type extraction, and leverage a bag of novel techniques such as Multi-Head Cross Attention (MHCA) and Local-Global Adaptive Instance Normalization (LG-AdaIN) to efficiently restore spatial varying weather degradation. The proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods subjectively and objectively on different weather removal tasks with a large margin, and enjoy less model parameters. Proposed method even can restore unseen combined multiple degradation images, and modulate restoration level. Implementation code and pre-trained weights will be available at \url{https://github.com/fordevoted/UtilityIR} 
A reactive fluid dissolving the surface of a uniform fracture will trigger an instability in the dissolution front, leading to spontaneous formation of pronounced well-spaced channels in the surrounding rock matrix. Although the underlying mechanism is similar to the wormhole instability in porous rocks there are significant differences in the physics, due to the absence of a steadily propagating reaction front. In previous work we have described the geophysical implications of this instability in regard to the formation of long conduits in soluble rocks. Here we describe a more general linear stability analysis, including axial diffusion, transport limited dissolution, non-linear kinetics, and a finite length system. 
Rock mass classification systems are crucial for assessing stability and risk in underground construction globally and guiding support and excavation design. However, systems developed primarily in the 1970s lack access to modern high-resolution data and advanced statistical techniques, limiting their effectiveness as decision-support systems. Initially, we outline the limitations observed in this context and later describe how a data-driven system, based on drilling data as detailed in this study, can overcome these limitations. Using extracted statistical information from thousands of MWD-data values in one-meter sections of a full tunnel profile, thus working as a signature of the rock mass, we have demonstrated that it is possible to form well-defined clusters that can act as a foundational basis for various rock mass classification systems. We reduced the dimensionality of 48-value vectors using nonlinear manifold learning techniques (UMAP) and linear principal component analysis (PCA) to enhance clustering. Unsupervised machine learning methods (HDBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, K-means) were employed to cluster the data, with hyperparameters optimised through multi-objective Bayesian optimisation for effective clustering. Using domain knowledge, we experienced improved clustering and system tuning opportunities in adding extra features to core clusters of MWD-data. We structured and correlated these clusters with physical rock mass properties, including labels of rock type and rock quality, and analysed cumulative distributions of key MWD-parameters for rock mass assessment to determine if clusters meaningfully differentiate rock masses. The ability of MWD data to form distinct rock mass clusters suggests substantial potential for future classification systems grounded in this objective, data-driven methodology, free from human bias. 
The proposed magnetized Iron CALorimeter detector (ICAL) to be built in the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) laboratory aims to study atmospheric neutrinos and its properties such as precision measurements of oscillation parameters and the neutrino mass hierarchy. High energy charged current (CC) interactions of atmospheric neutrinos with the rock surrounding the detector produce so-called "rock muons" along with hadrons. While the hadron component of these events are absorbed in the rock itself, the rock muons traverse the rock and are detected in the detector. These rock muon events can be distinguished from cosmic muons only in the upward direction and can provide an independent measurement of the oscillation parameters. A simulation study of these events at the ICAL detector shows that, although reduced in significance compared to muons produced in direct CC neutrino interactions with the detector, these events are indeed sensitive to the oscillation parameters, achieving a possible $1\sigma$ precision of 10\% and 27\% in determining $\Delta m_{32}^2$ and $\sin^2\theta_{23}$, respectively. Hence a combination of the standard atmospheric neutrino analysis which is the main goal of ICAL, with these rock muon events, will improve the precision reach of ICAL for these parameters. 
This work is concerned with the numerical simulation of ablation of geological materials using a millimetre wave source. To this end, a new mathematical model is developed for a thermal approach to the problem, allowing for large scale simulations, whilst being able to include the strong temperature dependence of material parameters to ensure accurate modelling of power input into the rock. The model presented is implemented within an adaptive meshing framework, such that resolution can be placed where needed, for example at the borehole wall, to further improve the computational efficiency of large scale simulations. This approach allows for both the heating of the rock, and the removal of evaporated material, allowing rate of penetration and the shape of the resulting borehole to be quantified. The model is validated against experimental results, which indicates that the approach can accurately predict temperatures, and temperature gradients within the rock. The validated model is then exercised to obtain initial results demonstrating its capabilities for simulating the millimetre wave drilling process. The effects of the conditions at the surface of the rock are investigated, highlighting the importance of understanding the physical processes which occur between the wave guide and the rock. Additionally, the absorptivity of the rock, and the impact this has on the evaporation behaviour is considered. Simulations are carried out both for isotropic rock, and also for a multi-strata configuration. It is found that strata between similar rock types, such as granite and basalt, absorptive properties pose little problem for uniform drilling. However, larger variations in material parameters are shown to have strong implications on the evaporation behaviour of the wellbore, and hence the resulting structure. 
We report a dataset containing full-scale, 3D images of rock plugs augmented by petrophysical lab characterization data for application in digital rock and capillary network analysis. Specifically, we have acquired microscopically resolved tomography datasets of 18 cylindrical sandstone and carbonate rock samples having lengths of 25.4 mm and diameters of 9.5 mm, respectively. Based on the micro-tomography data, we have computed porosity-values for each imaged rock sample. For validating the computed porosity values with a complementary lab method, we have measured porosity for each rock sample by using standard petrophysical characterization techniques. Overall, the tomography-based porosity values agree with the measurement results obtained from the lab, with values ranging from 8% to 30%. In addition, we provide for each rock sample the experimental permeabilities, with values ranging from 0.4 mD to above 5D. This dataset will be essential for establishing, benchmarking, and referencing the relation between porosity and permeability of reservoir rock at pore scale. 
We propose a novel physically-based multi-phase thermo-mechanical model for rock-ice avalanche. The model is built on a multi-phase mass flow model and extends a two-phase rock-ice avalanche model. It considers rock, ice and fluid; includes the mechanism of ice-melting and a rigorously derived dynamically changing general temperature equation for avalanching bulk mass, the first of its kind. It explains advection-diffusion of heat including the heat exchange across the rock-ice avalanche body, basal heat conduction, production and loss of heat due to frictional shearing and changing temperature, a general formulation of the ice melting rate and enhancement of temperature due to basal entrainment. The temperature equation includes a composite term containing coupled dynamics: rate of change of thermal conductivity and temperature. Ice melt intensity determines these rates as mixture conductivity evolves, characterizing distinctive thermo-mechanical processes. The model highlights essential aspects of rock-ice avalanches. Lateral heat productions play an important role in temperature evolution. Fast moving avalanches produce higher amount of heat. Fast ice melting results in substantial change in temperature. We formally derive the melting efficiency dependent general fluid production rate. The model includes internal mass and momentum exchanges between the phases and mass and momentum productions due to entrainment. The latter significantly changes the state of temperature; yet, the former exclusively characterizes rock-ice avalanche. Temperature changes are rapid when heat entrainment across the avalanche boundary is substantial. It also applies to basal heat conduction. A strong coupling exists between phase mass and momentum balances and the temperature equation. The new model offers the first-ever complete dynamical solution for simulating rock-ice avalanche with changing temperature. 
I propose a new conceptual framework to disentangle the impacts of weather and climate on economic activity and growth: A stochastic frontier model with climate in the production frontier and weather shocks as a source of inefficiency. I test it on a sample of 160 countries over the period 1950-2014. Temperature and rainfall determine production possibilities in both rich and poor countries; positively in cold countries and negatively in hot ones. Weather anomalies reduce inefficiency in rich countries but increase inefficiency in poor and hot countries; and more so in countries with low weather variability. The climate effect is larger that the weather effect. 
Considering effects of tidal plus centrifugal stress acting on icy-rocks and the tensile strength thereof, icy-rocks being in the density range (1-2.4) g cm-3 which had come into existence as collisional ejecta (debris) in the vicinity of Pluto at the time when Pluto-Charon system came into being as a result of a giant impact of a Kuiper Belt Object on the primordial Pluto, it is shown, here, that these rocks going around Pluto in its vicinity are under slow disruption generating a stable ring structure consisting of icy-rocks of diameters in the range (20-90) km, together with fine dust and particles disrupted off the rocks, and spread all over the regions in their respective Roche Zones, various Roche radii being in ~1/2 three-body mean motion resonance. Calculations of gravitational spheres of influence of Pluto which turns out to be 4.2 x 106 km for prograde orbits and 8.5 x 106 km for retrograde orbits together with the existence of Kuiper Belt in the vicinity of Pluto assure that there may exist a few rocks (satellites)/dust rings/sheets so far undiscovered moving in prograde orbits around the planet and few others which are distant ones and move around Pluto in the region between 4.2x106 km and 8.5x106 km in retrograde orbits. 
In this report we present a study on the strength of rocks which are partially fractured from before. We have considered a two dimensional case of a rock in the form of a lattice structure. The fiber bundle model is used for modelling the $2-D$ rock. Each lattice site is considered to be a fiber which has a breaking threshold. Fractures in this system will be of the form a cluster of sites and the length is defined as the number of sites belonging to a single cluster. We introduce fractures in the system initially and apply load until the rock breaks. The breaking of a rock is characterized by a horizontal fracture which connects the left side of the lattice to the right side. The length distribution and the strength of such systems have been measured. 
Fracturing in reservoir rocks is an important issue for the petroleum industry - as productivity can be enhanced by a controlled fracturing operation. Fracturing also has a big impact on CO2 storage, geothermal installation and gas production at and from the reservoir rocks. Therefore, understanding the fracturing behavior of different types of reservoir rocks is a basic need for planning field operations towards these activities. In our study, the fracturing of rock sample is monitored by Acoustic Emission (AE) and post-experiment Computer Tomography (CT) scans. The fracturing experiments have been performed on hollow cylinder cores of different rocks - sandstones and chalks. Our analysis show that the amplitudes and energies of acoustic events clearly indicate initiation and propagation of the main fractures. The amplitudes of AE events follow an exponential distribution while the energies follow a power law distribution. Time-evolution of the radial strain measured in the fracturing-test will later be compared to model predictions of fracture size. 
Scale invariance of intrinsic patterns is an important concept in geology that can be observed in numerous geological objects and phenomena. These geological objects and phenomena are described as containing statistically selfsimilar patterns often modeled with fractal geometry. Fractal geometry has been used extensively to characterize pore space and fracture distribution of both carbonate and clastic rocks as well as the transport properties of porous media and fluid flow in reservoirs. The fractal properties are usually estimated from thin-section photomicrograph images or scanning electron microscope images. For complex rock such as carbonate rocks, automatic feature detection methods are often inaccurate. In addition, the rocks may be have been subjected to facies selective diagenesis which preferentially affect some of the rock fabric, thus increasing the difficulty in automatic detection of certain features. We present an interactive program, GeoBoxCount, for analyzing thin-section images and calculating the fractal dimension interactively. The program relies on the geologists insight in interpreting the features of interest; this significantly improves the accuracy of feature selection. The program provides two options for calculating the fractal dimension: the Hausdorff and the Minkowsi-Bouligand box-counting methods. 
The rock-paper-scissors game, commonly played in East Asia, gives a simple model to understand physical, biological, psychological and other problems. The interacting rock-paper-scissors particle system is a point of contact between the kinetic theory of gases by Maxwell and Boltzmann ( collision model) and the coagulation theory by Smoluchowski ( coalescence model). A $2s+1$ types extended rock-paper-scissors collision model naturally introduces a nonlinear integrable system. The time evolution of the $2s+1$ types extended rock-paper-scissors coalescence model is obtained from the logarithmic time change of the nonlinear integrable system. We also discuss the behavior of a discrete rock-paper-scissors coalescence model. 
This article provides an overview of the current state of digital rock technology, with emphasis on industrial applications. We show how imaging and image analysis can be applied for rock typing and modeling of end-point saturations. Different methods to obtain a digital model of the pore space from pore scale images are presented, and the strengths and weaknesses of the different methods are discussed. We also show how imaging bridges the different subjects of geology, petrophysics and reservoir simulations, by being a common denominator for results in all these subjects. Network modeling is compared to direct simulations on grid models, and their respective strengths are discussed. Finally we present an example of digital rock technology applied to a sandstone oil reservoir. Results from digital rock modeling are compared to results from traditional laboratory experiments. We highlight the mutual benefits from conducting both traditional experiments and digital rock modeling. 
Given that the coupling of a framing structure to a strong, rocking wall enforces a first-mode response, this paper investigates the dynamic response of a yielding single-degree-of-freedom oscillator coupled to a rocking wall with supplemental damping (hysteretic or linear viscous) along its sides. The full nonlinear equations of motion are derived, and the study presents an earthquake response analysis in term of inelastic spectra. The study shows that for structures with preyielding period T1<1.0 s the effect of supplemental damping along the sides of the rocking wall is marginal even when large values of damping are used. The study uncovers that occasionally the damped response matches or exceeds the undamped response; however, when this happens, the exceedance is marginal. The paper concludes that for yielding structures with strength less than 10% of their weight the use of supplemental damping along the sides of a rocking wall coupled to a yielding structure is not recommended. The paper shows that supplemental damping along the sides of the rocking wall may have some limited beneficial effects for structures with longer preyielding periods (say T1>1.0 s). Nevertheless, no notable further response reduction is observed when larger values of hysteretic or viscous damping are used. 
The high occupancy rates in urban multi-story buildings, combined with present safety concerns, necessarily prompt a reassessment of performance goals. Given the notable seismic damage and instances of weak-story failures that have been documented after major earthquakes, this paper studies the use of modular shear walls that are free to rock above their foundation. This paper first provides a comprehensive background in analysis of rocking elements such as columns and shear-walls. Then discusses different configurations of rocking-shear-walls. Next, the paper provides two numerical case studies on 9-story and 20-story moment-resisting frames using OpenSees. The floor displacement and interstory drifts under various earthquake excitations for both structures compared for the cases of with and without modular rocking walls. The result shows that the addition of rocking-shear-wall, makes the first mode of the frame becomes dominant which enforces a uniform distribution of interstory drifts that would avoid a soft-story failure. 
Current LiDAR-based Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) multi-agent perception systems have shown the significant success on 3D object detection. While these models perform well in the trained clean weather, they struggle in unseen adverse weather conditions with the real-world domain gap. In this paper, we propose a domain generalization approach, named V2X-DGW, for LiDAR-based 3D object detection on multi-agent perception system under adverse weather conditions. Not only in the clean weather does our research aim to ensure favorable multi-agent performance, but also in the unseen adverse weather conditions by learning only on the clean weather data. To advance research in this area, we have simulated the impact of three prevalent adverse weather conditions on two widely-used multi-agent datasets, resulting in the creation of two novel benchmark datasets: OPV2V-w and V2XSet-w.   To this end, we first introduce the Adaptive Weather Augmentation (AWA) to mimic the unseen adverse weather conditions, and then propose two alignments for generalizable representation learning: Trust-region Weather-invariant Alignment (TWA) and Agent-aware Contrastive Alignment (ACA). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our V2X-DGW achieved improvements in the unseen adverse weather conditions. 
Artificial intelligence (AI)-based data-driven weather forecasting models have experienced rapid progress over the last years. Recent studies, with models trained on reanalysis data, achieve impressive results and demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art physics-based numerical weather prediction models across a range of variables and evaluation metrics. Beyond improved predictions, the main advantages of data-driven weather models are their substantially lower computational costs and the faster generation of forecasts, once a model has been trained. However, most efforts in data-driven weather forecasting have been limited to deterministic, point-valued predictions, making it impossible to quantify forecast uncertainties, which is crucial in research and for optimal decision making in applications. Our overarching aim is to systematically study and compare uncertainty quantification methods to generate probabilistic weather forecasts from a state-of-the-art deterministic data-driven weather model, Pangu-Weather. Specifically, we compare approaches for quantifying forecast uncertainty based on generating ensemble forecasts via perturbations to the initial conditions, with the use of statistical and machine learning methods for post-hoc uncertainty quantification. In a case study on medium-range forecasts of selected weather variables over Europe, the probabilistic forecasts obtained by using the Pangu-Weather model in concert with uncertainty quantification methods show promising results and provide improvements over ensemble forecasts from the physics-based ensemble weather model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts for lead times of up to 5 days. 
As renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) penetrate the power grid at an accelerating speed, it is essential for operators to have accurate solar photovoltaic (PV) energy forecasting for efficient operations and planning. Generally, observed weather data are applied in the solar PV generation forecasting model while in practice the energy forecasting is based on forecasted weather data. In this paper, a study on the uncertainty in weather forecasting for the most commonly used weather variables is presented. The forecasted weather data for six days ahead is compared with the observed data and the results of analysis are quantified by statistical metrics. In addition, the most influential weather predictors in energy forecasting model are selected. The performance of historical and observed weather data errors is assessed using a solar PV generation forecasting model. Finally, a sensitivity test is performed to identify the influential weather variables whose accurate values can significantly improve the results of energy forecasting. 
Weather conditions often disrupt the proper functioning of transportation systems. Present systems either deploy an array of sensors or use an in-vehicle camera to predict weather conditions. These solutions have resulted in incremental cost and limited scope. To ensure smooth operation of all transportation services in all-weather conditions, a reliable detection system is necessary to classify weather in wild. The challenges involved in solving this problem is that weather conditions are diverse in nature and there is an absence of discriminate features among various weather conditions. The existing works to solve this problem have been scene specific and have targeted classification of two categories of weather. In this paper, we have created a new open source dataset consisting of images depicting three classes of weather i.e rain, snow and fog called RFS Dataset. A novel algorithm has also been proposed which has used super pixel delimiting masks as a form of data augmentation, leading to reasonable results with respect to ten Convolutional Neural Network architectures. 
The use of weather index insurances is subject to spatial basis risk, which arises from the fact that the location of the user's risk exposure is not the same as the location of any of the weather stations where an index can be measured. To gauge the effectiveness of weather index insurances, spatial interpolation techniques such as kriging can be adopted to estimate the relevant weather index from observations taken at nearby locations. In this paper, we study the performance of various statistical methods, ranging from simple nearest neighbor to more advanced trans-Gaussian kriging, in spatial interpolations of daily precipitations with data obtained from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We also investigate how spatial interpolations should be implemented in practice when the insurance is linked to popular weather indexes including annual consecutive dry days ($CDD$) and maximum five-day precipitation in one month ($MFP$). It is found that although spatially interpolating the raw weather variables on a daily basis is more sophisticated and computationally demanding, it does not necessarily yield superior results compared to direct interpolations of $CDD$/$MFP$ on a yearly/monthly basis. This intriguing outcome can be explained by the statistical properties of the weather indexes and the underlying weather variables. 
All-in-one (AiO) frameworks restore various adverse weather degradations with a single set of networks jointly. To handle various weather conditions, an AiO framework is expected to adaptively learn weather-specific knowledge for different degradations and shared knowledge for common patterns. However, existing methods: 1) rely on extra supervision signals, which are usually unknown in real-world applications; 2) employ fixed network structures, which restrict the diversity of weather-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Language-driven Restoration framework (LDR) to alleviate the aforementioned issues. First, we leverage the power of pre-trained vision-language (PVL) models to enrich the diversity of weather-specific knowledge by reasoning about the occurrence, type, and severity of degradation, generating description-based degradation priors. Then, with the guidance of degradation prior, we sparsely select restoration experts from a candidate list dynamically based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure. This enables us to adaptively learn the weather-specific and shared knowledge to handle various weather conditions (e.g., unknown or mixed weather). Experiments on extensive restoration scenarios show our superior performance (see Fig. 1). The source code will be made available. 
Operational weather forecasting system relies on computationally expensive physics-based models. Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. We evaluate STC-ViT against a operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT performs competitively with current data-driven methods in global forecasting while only being trained at lower resolution data and with less compute power. 
Current rock engineering design in drill and blast tunnelling primarily relies on engineers' observational assessments. Measure While Drilling (MWD) data, a high-resolution sensor dataset collected during tunnel excavation, is underutilised, mainly serving for geological visualisation. This study aims to automate the translation of MWD data into actionable metrics for rock engineering. It seeks to link data to specific engineering actions, thus providing critical decision support for geological challenges ahead of the tunnel face. Leveraging a large and geologically diverse dataset of 500,000 drillholes from 15 tunnels, the research introduces models for accurate rock mass quality classification in a real-world tunnelling context. Both conventional machine learning and image-based deep learning are explored to classify MWD data into Q-classes and Q-values, examples of metrics describing the stability of the rock mass, using both tabular and image data. The results indicate that the K-nearest neighbours algorithm in an ensemble with tree-based models using tabular data, effectively classifies rock mass quality. It achieves a cross-validated balanced accuracy of 0.86 in classifying rock mass into the Q-classes A, B, C, D, E1, E2, and 0.95 for a binary classification with E versus the rest. Classification using a CNN with MWD-images for each blasting round resulted in a balanced accuracy of 0.82 for binary classification. Regressing the Q-value from tabular MWD-data achieved cross-validated R2 and MSE scores of 0.80 and 0.18 for a similar ensemble model as in classification. High performance in regression and classification boosts confidence in automated rock mass assessment. Applying advanced modelling on a unique dataset demonstrates MWD data's value in improving rock mass classification accuracy and advancing data-driven rock engineering design, reducing manual intervention. 
The effects of weather on agriculture in recent years have become a major global concern. Hence, the need for an effective weather risk management tool (i.e., weather derivatives) that can hedge crop yields against weather uncertainties. However, most smallholder farmers and agricultural stakeholders are unwilling to pay for the price of weather derivatives (WD) because of the presence of basis risks (product-design and geographical) in the pricing models. To eliminate product-design basis risks, a machine learning ensemble technique was used to determine the relationship between maize yield and weather variables. The results revealed that the most significant weather variable that affected the yield of maize was average temperature. A mean-reverting model with a time-varying speed of mean reversion, seasonal mean, and local volatility that depended on the local average temperature was then proposed. The model was extended to a multi-dimensional model for different but correlated locations. Based on these average temperature models, pricing models for futures, options on futures, and basket futures for cumulative average temperature and growing degree-days are presented. Pricing futures on baskets reduces geographical basis risk, as buyers have the opportunity to select the most appropriate weather stations with their desired weight preference. With these pricing models, farmers and agricultural stakeholders can hedge their crops against the perils of extreme weather. 
Weather events put human lives at risk mostly when people might reside in areas susceptible to natural disasters. Weather monitoring is a pivotal task that is accomplished in vulnerable areas with the support of reliable weather stations. Such stations are front-end equipment typically mounted on a fixed mast structure with a set of digital and magnetic weather sensors connected to a datalogger. While remote sensing from a number of stations is paramount, the cost of professional weather instruments is extremely high. This imposes a challenge for large-scale deployment and maintenance of weather stations for broad natural disaster monitoring. To address this problem, in this paper, we validate the hypothesis that a Low-Cost Automatic Weather Station system (LCAWS) entirely developed from commercial-off-the-shelf and open-source IoT technologies is able to provide data as reliable as a Professional Weather Station (PWS) of reference for natural disaster monitoring. To achieve data reliability, we propose an intelligent sensor calibration method to correct weather parameters. From the experimental results of a 30-day uninterrupted observation period, we show that the results of the calibrated LCAWS sensors have no statistically significant differences with the PWS's results. Together with The Brazilian National Center for Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters (Cemaden), LCAWS has opened new opportunities towards reducing maintenance cost of its weather observational network. 
Segmenting each moving object instance in a scene is essential for many applications. But like many other computer vision tasks, this task performs well in optimal weather, but then adverse weather tends to fail. To be robust in weather conditions, the usual way is to train network in data of given weather pattern or to fuse multiple sensors. We focus on a new possibility, that is, to improve its resilience to weather interference through the network's structural design. First, we propose a novel FPN structure called RiWFPN with a progressive top-down interaction and attention refinement module. RiWFPN can directly replace other FPN structures to improve the robustness of the network in non-optimal weather conditions. Then we extend SOLOV2 to capture temporal information in video to learn motion information, and propose a moving object instance segmentation network with RiWFPN called RiWNet. Finally, in order to verify the effect of moving instance segmentation in different weather disturbances, we propose a VKTTI-moving dataset which is a moving instance segmentation dataset based on the VKTTI dataset, taking into account different weather scenes such as rain, fog, sunset, morning as well as overcast. The experiment proves how RiWFPN improves the network's resilience to adverse weather effects compared to other FPN structures. We compare RiWNet to several other state-of-the-art methods in some challenging datasets, and RiWNet shows better performance especially under adverse weather conditions. 
Robust point cloud parsing under all-weather conditions is crucial to level-5 autonomy in autonomous driving. However, how to learn a universal 3D semantic segmentation (3DSS) model is largely neglected as most existing benchmarks are dominated by point clouds captured under normal weather. We introduce SemanticSTF, an adverse-weather point cloud dataset that provides dense point-level annotations and allows to study 3DSS under various adverse weather conditions. We study all-weather 3DSS modeling under two setups: 1) domain adaptive 3DSS that adapts from normal-weather data to adverse-weather data; 2) domain generalizable 3DSS that learns all-weather 3DSS models from normal-weather data. Our studies reveal the challenge while existing 3DSS methods encounter adverse-weather data, showing the great value of SemanticSTF in steering the future endeavor along this very meaningful research direction. In addition, we design a domain randomization technique that alternatively randomizes the geometry styles of point clouds and aggregates their embeddings, ultimately leading to a generalizable model that can improve 3DSS under various adverse weather effectively. The SemanticSTF and related codes are available at \url{https://github.com/xiaoaoran/SemanticSTF}. 
Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather, to planning renewable energy use. Here, we introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, the European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF)'s ensemble forecast, ENS. Unlike traditional approaches, which are based on numerical weather prediction (NWP), GenCast is a machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-hour steps and 0.25 degree latitude-longitude resolution, for over 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 minutes. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.4% of 1320 targets we evaluated, and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclones, and wind power production. This work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, where critical weather-dependent decisions are made with greater accuracy and efficiency. 
Metal hydrides are critical materials in numerous technologies including hydrogen storage, gas separation, and electrocatalysis. Here, using Pd-H as a model metal hydride, we perform electrochemical insertion studies of hydrogen via liquid and solid state electrolytes at 1 atm ambient pressure, and achieve H:Pd ratios near unity, the theoretical solubility limit. We show that the compositions achieved result from a dynamic balance between the rate of hydrogen insertion and evolution from the Pd lattice, the combined kinetics of which are sufficiently rapid that operando experiments are necessary to characterize instantaneous PdHx composition. We use simultaneous electrochemical insertion and X-ray diffraction measurements, combined with a new calibration of lattice parameter versus hydrogen concentration, to enable accurate quantification of the composition of electrochemically synthesized PdHx. Furthermore, we show that the achievable hydrogen concentration is severely limited by electrochemomechanical damage to the palladium and/or substrate. The understanding embodied in these results helps to establish new design rules for achieving high hydrogen concentrations in metal hydrides. 
This work explores the use of joint density-functional theory, a new form of density-functional theory for the ab initio description of electronic systems in thermodynamic equilibrium with a liquid environment, to describe electrochemical systems. After reviewing the physics of the underlying fundamental electrochemical concepts, we identify the mapping between commonly measured electrochemical observables and microscopically computable quantities within an, in principle, exact theoretical framework. We then introduce a simple, computationally efficient approximate functional which we find to be quite successful in capturing a priori basic electrochemical phenomena, including the capacitive Stern and diffusive Gouy-Chapman regions in the electrochemical double layer, quantitative values for interfacial capacitance, and electrochemical potentials of zero charge for a series of metals. We explore surface charging with applied potential and are able to place our ab initio results directly on the scale associated with the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). Finally, we provide explicit details for implementation within standard density-functional theory software packages at negligible computational cost over standard calculations carried out within vacuum environments. 
We study the loss of coherence of electrochemical oscillations on meso- and nanosized electrodes with numeric simulations of the electrochemical master equation for a prototypical electrochemical oscillator, the hydrogen peroxide reduction on Pt electrodes in the presence of halides. On nanoelectrodes, the electrode potential changes whenever a stochastic electron-transfer event takes place. Electrochemical reaction rate coefficients depend exponentially on the electrode potential and become thus fluctuating quantities as well. Therefore, also the transition rates between system states become time-dependent which constitutes a fundamental difference to purely chemical nanoscale oscillators. Three implications are demonstrated: (a) oscillations and steady states shift in phase space with decreasing system size, thereby also decreasing considerably the oscillating parameter regions; (b) the minimal number of molecules necessary to support correlated oscillations is more than 10 times as large as for nanoscale chemical oscillators; (c) the relation between correlation time and variance of the period of the oscillations predicted for chemical oscillators in the weak noise limit is only fulfilled in a very restricted parameter range for the electrochemical nano-oscillator. 
Metallization of initially insulating VO2 via ionic liquid electrolytes (electrolyte gating) has recently been a topic of much interest. It is clear that the metallization takes place electrochemically and there has previously been extensive evidence for the removal of small amounts of oxygen during ionic liquid gating. Hydrogen intercalation has also been proposed, but the source of the hydrogen has remained unclear. In this work, solid-state magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy is used to investigate the thermal metal-insulator transition in VO2, before progressing to catalytically hydrogenated and electrochemically metallized VO2. Electrochemical metallization of bulk VO2 particles is shown to be associated with intercalation of hydrogen, the degree of which can be measured with quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy. Possible sources of the hydrogen are explored, and by using a selectively deuterated ionic liquid, it is revealed that the hydrogenation is due to deprotonation of the ionic liquid; specifically, for the commonly used dialkylimidazolium based ionic liquids, it is the "carbene" proton that is responsible. Increasing the temperature of the electrochemistry is shown to increase the degree of hydrogenation, forming first a less hydrogenated metallic phase then a more hydrogenated insulating Curie-Weiss paramagnetic phase, both of which were also observed for catalytically hydrogenated VO2. The NMR results are supported by magnetic susceptibility measurements, which corroborate the degree of Pauli and Curie-Weiss paramagnetism. NMR spectroscopy is used to identify the presence of hydrogen in an electrolyte gated thin film of VO2, suggesting that electrolyte breakdown, proton intercalation and reactions with decomposition products within the electrolyte should not be ignored when interpreting the electronic and structural changes observed in electrochemical gating experiments. 
The electric conductance of Rh atomic contacts was investigated under the electrochemical potential control. The conductance histogram of Rh atomic contacts varied with the electrochemical potential. When the electrochemical potential of the contact was kept at $\Phi_{0}$= 0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl (Rh potential), the conductance histogram did not show any features. At $\Phi_{0}$= -0.1 V (under potential deposited hydrogen potential), the conductance histogram showed a feature around 2.3 $G_{0}$ ($G_{0}$ =2$e^{2}/h$), which agreed with the conductance value of a clean Rh atomic contact, which was observed in ultrahigh vacuum at low temperature. At $\Phi_{0}$= -0.25 V (over potential deposited hydrogen potential), the conductance histogram showed features around 0.3 and 1.0 $G_{0}$. The conductance behavior of the Rh atomic contact was discussed by comparing previously reported results of other metals, Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni, Co, and Fe. The conductance behavior of the metal atomic contacts related with the strength of the interaction between hydrogen and metal surface. 
A novel electrochemical means to generate atomic hydrogen, simplifying the synthesis and controllability of graphane formation on graphene is presented. High quality, vacuum grown epitaxial graphene (EG) was used as starting material for graphane conversion. A home-built electrochemical cell with Pt wire and exposed graphene as the anode and cathode, respectively, was used to attract H+ ions to react with the exposed graphene. Cyclic voltammetry of the cell revealed the potential of the conversion reaction as well as oxidation and reduction peaks, suggesting the possibility of electrochemically reversible hydrogenation. A sharp increase in D peak in the Raman spectra of EG, increase of D/G ratio, introduction of a peak at ~2930 cm-1 and respective peak shifts as well as a sharp increase in resistance showed the successful hydrogenation of EG. This conversion was distinguished from lattice damage by thermal reversal back to graphene at 1000{\deg}C. 
Water is a life-giving source, fundamental to human existence, yet, over a billion people lack access to clean drinking water. Present techniques for water treatment such as piped, treated water rely on time and resource intensive centralized solutions. In this work, we propose a decentralized device concept that can utilize sunlight to split water into hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide can oxidize organics while the hydrogen bubbles out. In enabling this device, we require an electrocatalyst that can oxidize water while suppressing the thermodynamically favored oxygen evolution and form hydrogen peroxide. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that the free energy of adsorbed OH$^*$ can be used as a descriptor to screen for selectivity trends between the 2e$^-$ water oxidation to H$_2$O$_2$ and the 4e$^-$ oxidation to O$_2$. We show that materials that bind oxygen intermediates sufficiently weakly, such as SnO$_2$, can activate hydrogen peroxide evolution. We present a rational design principle for the selectivity in electrochemical water oxidation and identify new material candidates that could perform H$_2$O$_2$ evolution selectively. 
Recently, the coupling of ferroelectrics with electrochemical reactions has attracted increasing interest for harvesting waste heat. The change of polarisation of a ferroelectric with temperature can be used to influence chemical reactions, especially when the material is cycled near its Curie temperature. In this perspective, we introduce the principle of pyroelectric controlled electrochemical processes by harvesting waste heat energy and explore their potential electrochemical applications, such as water treatment, air purificiation and hydrogen generation. As an emerging approach for driving electrochemical reactions, the presence of thermal fluctuations and/or transient waste heat in the environment has the potential to be the primary thermal input for driving the change in polarisation of a pyroelectric to release charge for such reactions. There are a number of avenues to explore and we summarize strategies for forming multi-functional or hybrid materials and future directions such as selecting pyroelectrics with low Curie temperature (< 100 {\deg}C), improved heat conductivity, enhanced surface area or porosity, tailored microstructures and systems capable of operating over a broader temperature range. 
In the future, when fossil fuels are exhausted, alternative energy sources will be essential for everyday needs. Hydrogen-based energy can play a vital role in this aspect. This energy is green, clean, and renewable. Elec-trochemical hydrogen devices have been used extensively in nuclear power plants to manage hydrogen-based renewable fuel. Doped zirconate materials are commonly used as an electrolyte in these electrochemical devices. These materials have excellent physical stability and high proton transport numbers, which make them suitable for multiple applications. Doping enhances the physical and electronic properties of zirconate materials and makes them ideal for practical applications. This review highlights the applications of zirconate-based pro-ton-conducting materials in electrochemical cells, particularly in tritium monitors, tritium recovery, hydrogen sensors, and hydrogen pump systems. The central section of this review summarizes recent investigations and provides a comprehensive insight into the various doping schemes, experimental setup, instrumentation, op-timum operating conditions, morphology, composition, and performance of zirconate electrolyte materials. In addition, different challenges that are hindering zirconate materials from achieving their full potential in elec-trochemical hydrogen devices are discussed. Finally, this paper lays out a few pathways for aspirants who wish to undertake research in this field. 
We present a theoretical and numerical scheme that enables quantifying hydrogen ingress in metals for arbitrary environments and defect geometries. This is achieved by explicitly resolving the electrochemical behaviour of the electrolyte, the hydrogen and corrosion reactions, the kinetics of surface adsorption, and hydrogen uptake, diffusion and trapping in mechanically-deforming solids. This new framework is used to produce maps that relate the absorbed hydrogen with the applied potential, specimen geometry and fluid velocity. We also present simplified versions of our generalised model, and benchmark predictions of these and other existing models against the generalised electro-chemo-mechanical results, establishing regimes of validity. 
MoS2 are facile, stable, non-toxic, affordable materials with reasonable price, and have exhibit its superior potential in catalysis, sensing, opt electrochemical, environmental relate application1, etc. Modification of MoS2 materials has been widely applied for adjusting and formulate the relative performance in certain application field. Making vacancy, doping with other atoms, expending of the layer space, heterojunction engineering, phase engineering etc. have been applied to facilitate the catalytic hydrogen evolution performance. We make a detailed summary on MoS2 characterization methods, synthesis, HER performance, mechanisms, to make a holistic understanding on the interplay between the structure, chemistry, and HER performance, which will give directions to elevate other electrochemical reaction by MoS2. 
The diffusivity of hydrogen in cold-rolled pure iron is investigated using permeation and desorption methods. Electrochemical charging, electro-permeation and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) experiments are conducted. Firstly, the relation between the charging current and the hydrogen concentration is established. Secondly, permeation experiments are conducted at 22, 40 and 67{\deg}C to quantify the diffusivity dependence on temperature. Finally, the diffusivity is estimated by using two types of desorption experiments and Fick's law: (i) a `rest time' method, by which we measure the hydrogen content of samples held at room temperature for different times, and (ii) isothermal desorption experiments at temperatures ranging from 22 to 80{\deg}C, fitting the resulting desorption rate versus time curves. Good agreement is obtained between the isothermal desorption and permeation approaches, with observed differences discussed and rationalised. Moreover, measured diffusivity values for cold-rolled pure iron are also found to be comparable to those reported in the literature. This work demonstrates that isothermal desorption experiments are a convenient approach to determine hydrogen diffusivity over a wide range of temperatures, as facilitated by new TDS systems with fast heating rates. 
Hydrogen is largely produced via natural gas reforming or electrochemical water-splitting, leaving organic solid feedstocks under-utilized. Plasma technology powered by renewable electricity can lead to the sustainable upcycling of plastic waste and production of green hydrogen. In this work, low-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma reactors based on transferred arc (transarc) and gliding arc (glidarc) discharges are designed, built, and characterized to produce hydrogen from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) as a model plastic waste. Experimental results show that hydrogen production rate and efficiency increase monotonically with increasing voltage level in both reactors, with the maximum hydrogen production of 0.33 and 0.42 mmol/g LDPE for transarc and glidarc reactors, respectively. For the transarc reactor, smaller electrode-feedstock spacing favors greater hydrogen production, whereas, for the glidarc reactor, greater hydrogen production is obtained at intermediate flow rates. The hydrogen production from LDPE is comparable despite the markedly different modes of operation between the two reactors. 
The potential of using hydrogen as a sustainable energy carrier is attributed to its high energy density and its utilization without CO$_2$ emissions. Existing technologies mainly produce hydrogen thermochemically via natural gas reforming or electrochemically through water splitting. Organic solid feedstocks rich in hydrogen, such as biomass and plastic waste, are under-utilized for this purpose. Approaches based on low-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma powered by renewable electricity could lead to the production of green hydrogen more viably than current approaches, leading to sustainable alternatives for upcycling plastic and biomass waste. This doctoral research dissertation focuses on the production of hydrogen from solids via atmospheric nonthermal plasma. First, two low-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma reactors, based on transferred arc (transarc) and gliding arc (glidarc) discharges and depicting complementary operational characteristics, are designed, built, and characterized to produce hydrogen from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) as a model plastic waste. Experimental results show that hydrogen production rate and efficiency increase monotonically with increasing voltage level in both reactors. Despite the reactors' markedly different modes of operation, their hydrogen production performance metrics are comparable. 
Clean hydrogen production through efficient and cost-effective electrochemical water splitting is highly promising to meeting future global energy demands. The design of Earth-abundant materials with both high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrochemical stability in both acidic and alkaline environments summarize the outcomes needed for practical applications. Here, we report a non-noble 3d metal Cl-chemical doping of liquid phase exfoliated single/few-layer flakes of MoSe2 for creating MoSe2 nanoflakes/3d metal oxide-hydr(oxy)oxide hybrid HER-catalysts. We propose that the electron-transfer from MoSe2 nanoflakes to metal cations and the chlorine complexation-induced both neutralization, as well as the in situ formation of metal oxide-hydr(oxy)oxides on MoSe2 nanoflake's surface, tailor the proton affinity of the derived catalysts, increasing the number and HER-kinetic of their active sites in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The electrochemical coupling between the doped-MoSe2 nanoflakes/metal oxide-hydr(oxy)oxide hybrids and single-walled carbon nanotubes heterostructures further accelerates the HER process. Lastly, monolithic stacking of multiple heterostructures is reported as a facile electrode assembly strategy to achieve overpotential for a cathodic current density of 10mAcm-2 of 0.081V and 0.064V in 0.5M H2SO4 and 1M KOH, respectively. This opens up new opportunities to address the current density vs. overpotential requirements targeted in pH-universal H2 production. 
Para- and ortho- isomers of water have different chemical and physical properties. Excitations by magnetic field, laser emission or hydrodynamic cavitation are reported to change energetic levels and spin configurations of water molecules that in turn change macroscopically measurable properties of aqueous solutions. Similar scheme is also explored for dissolved molecular oxygen, where physical excitations form singlet oxygen with different spin configurations and generate a long chain of ionic and free-radical reactions. This work utilizes electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to characterize ionic dynamics of proposed spin conversion methods applied to dissolving of carbon dioxide CO$_2$ and hydrogen peroxide H$_2$O$_2$ in pure water excited by fluctuating weak magnetic field in uT range. Measurement results demonstrate different ionic reactivities and surface tension effects triggered by excitations at 10$^{-8}$J/mL. The CO$_2$- and O$_2$-related reaction pathways are well distinguishable by EIS. Control experiments without CO$_2$/H$_2$O$_2$ input show no significant effects. Dynamics of electrochemical impedances and temperature of fluids indicates anomalous quasi-periodical fluctuations pointing to possible carbonate-induced cyclic reactions or cyclical spin conversion processes. This approach can underlay development of affordable sensors operating with spin conversion technologies. 
Electrocatalysis plays a crucial role in realizing the transition towards green energy, driving research directions from hydrogen generation to carbon dioxide reduction. Understanding electrochemical reactions is crucial to improve their efficiency and to bridge the gap toward a sustainable zero-carbon future. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) is a suitable method for investigating these processes because it can monitor with chemical specificity the mechanisms of the reactions. However, it remains difficult to detect many relevant aspects of electrochemical reactions such as short-lived intermediates. Here, we develop and experimentally realize an integrated nanophotonic-electrochemical SEIRAS platform for the in situ investigation of molecular signal traces emerging during electrochemical experiments. Specifically, we implement a platinum nano-slot metasurface featuring strongly enhanced electromagnetic near fields and spectrally target it at the weak vibrational bending mode of adsorbed CO at ~2033 cm-1. Crucially, our platinum nano-slot metasurface provides high molecular sensitivity. The resonances can be tuned over a broad range in the mid-infrared spectrum. Compared to conventional unstructured platinum layers, our nanophotonic-electrochemical platform delivers a substantial improvement of the experimentally detected characteristic absorption signals by a factor of 27, enabling the detection of new species with weak signals, fast conversions, or low surface concentrations. By providing a deeper understanding of catalytic reactions, we anticipate our nanophotonic-electrochemical platform to open exciting perspectives for electrochemical SEIRAS, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and the study of reactions in other fields of chemistry such as photoelectrocatalysis. 
High-manganese twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steels exhibit high strain hardening, high tensile strength, and high ductility, which make them attractive for structural applications. At low tensile strain rates, TWIP steels are prone to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Here though, we study the hardening and strengthening resulting from electrochemical hydrogen-charging of a surface layer of a Fe-26.9Mn-0.28C (wt.%) TWIP steel. We observed a 20% increase in yield strength following the electrochemical hydrogen-charging, accompanied by a reduction in ductility from 75% to 10% at a tensile strain rate of 10-3s-1. The microstructural evolution during tensile deformation was examined at strain levels of 3%, 5% and 7% by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) to study the dislocation structure of the hardened region. As expected, the microstructure of the hydrogen-hardened and the uncharged regions of the material evolve differently. The uncharged areas show entangled dislocation structures, indicating slip from a limited number of potentially coplanar slip systems. In contrast, hydrogen segregated to the grain boundaries, revealed by the deuterium-labelled atom probe tomography, delays the dislocation nucleation by blocking dislocation sources at the grain boundaries. The charged areas hence first show the formation of cells, indicating dislocation entanglement from more non-coplanar slip systems. With increasing strain, these cells dissolve, and stacking faults and strain-induced {\epsilon}-martensite are formed, promoted by the presence of hydrogen. The influence of hydrogen on dislocation structures and the overall deformation mechanism is discussed in details. 
Due to the low conductivity of pure water, using an electrolyte is common for achieving efficient water electrolysis. In this paper, we have broken through this common sense by using deep-sub-Debye-length nanogap electrochemical cells for the electrolysis of pure water. At such nanometer scale, the field-driven pure water splitting exhibits a completely different mechanism from the macrosystem. We have named this process 'virtual breakdown mechanism' that results in a series of fundamental changes and more than 10^5-fold enhancement of the equivalent conductivity of pure water. This fundamental discovery has been theoretically discussed in this paper and experimentally demonstrated in a group of electrochemical cells with nanogaps between two electrodes down to 37 nm. Based on our nanogap electrochemical cells, the electrolysis current from pure water is comparable to or even larger than the current from 1 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution, indicating the high-efficiency of pure water splitting as a potential for on-demand hydrogen production. 
High-entropy alloys (HEAs) and their corresponding high-entropy hydrides are new potential candidates for negative electrode materials of nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. This study investigates the cyclic electrochemical hydrogen storage performance of two AB-type HEAs (A: hydride-forming elements, B: non-hydride-forming elements) in Ni-MH batteries. TiV2ZrCrMnFeNi with a dual-phase structure shows a fast activation and a low charge transfer impedance with a discharge capacity of 150 mAhg-1, while TiV1.5Zr1.5CrMnFeNi with a single phase shows a slow activation and a capacity of only 60 mAhg-1. The better electrochemical performance of TiV2ZrCrMnFeNi was attributed to its higher vanadium/zirconium ratio and abundant interphase boundaries, which act as hydrogen paths and heterogeneous hydride nucleation sites. These results suggest the high potential of dual-phase HEAs as new active electrode materials for Ni-MH batteries. 
An ideal material for on-board hydrogen storage must release hydrogen at practical temperature and pressure and also regenerate efficiently under similarly gentle conditions. Therefore, thermodynamically, the hydride material must lie within a narrow range near the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation phase boundary. Materials involving only conventional bonding mechanisms are unlikely to meet these requirements. In contrast, materials containing certain frustrated bonding are designed to be on the verge of frustration-induced phase transition, and they may be better suited for hydrogen storage. Here we propose a novel layered solid boron hydride and show its potential for hydrogen storage. The absence of soft phonon modes confirms the dynamical stability of the structure. Charging the structure significantly softens hydrogen-related phonon modes. Boron-related phonons, in contrast, are either hardened or not significantly affected by electron doping. These results suggest that electrochemical charging may facilitate hydrogen release while the underlying boron network remains intact for subsequent rehydrogenation. 
We report the performance of a hydrogen-chlorine electrochemical cell with a chlorine electrode employing a low precious metal content alloy oxide electrocatalyst for the chlorine electrode: (Ru_0.09Co_0.91)_3O_4. The cell employs a commercial hydrogen fuel cell electrode and transports protons through a Nafion membrane in both galvanic and electrolytic mode. The peak galvanic power density exceeds 1 W cm^-2, which is twice previous literature values. The precious metal loading of the chlorine electrode is below 0.15 mg Ru cm^-2. Virtually no activation losses are observed, allowing the cell to run at nearly 0.4 W cm^-2 at 90% voltage efficiency. We report the effects of fluid pressure, electrolyte acid concentration, and hydrogen-side humidification on overall cell performance and efficiency. A comparison of our results to the model of Rugolo et al. [Rugolo et al., J. Electrochem. Soc., 2012, 159, B133] points out directions for further performance enhancement. The performance reported here gives these devices promise for applications in carbon sequestration and grid-scale electrical energy storage. 
We consider the problem of hydrogen storage integration in microgrids to improve the electricity supply resilience. Nonlinear effects from electrochemical models of electrolyzers and fuel cells for hydrogen storage are considered, making scheduling under the nonlinear model intractable and the conventional linear approximation infeasible. A piecewise linear model approximation with feasibility projection is proposed, resulting in a computationally efficient model predictive control for hydrogen storage operation. Several resilience performance measures, such as loss-of-load, duration-of-outage, and system cost, are used in performance evaluation. Simulations for the proposed optimization demonstrated a 13%-48% reduction in duration-of-outage, a 6.4%-21.7% reduction in system cost, and a 95% reduction in loss-of-load for critical loads compared to the scheduling algorithm involving linear model approximation. The performance gap of the proposed optimization to the benchmark involving the accurate nonlinear electrochemical model is less than 1% in most metrics. 
Hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms of steels have been studied for several decades. Understanding hydrogen diffusion behavior in steels is crucial towards both developing predictive models for hydrogen embrittlement and identifying mitigation strategies. However, because hydrogen has a low atomic mass, it is extremely challenging to detect by most analytical methods. In recent years, cryogenic-transfer atom probe tomography (APT) of electrochemically-deuterium-charged steels has provided invaluable qualitative analysis of nanoscale deuterium traps such as carbides, dislocations, grain boundaries and interfaces between ferrite and cementite. Independently, cyclic voltammetry (CV) has provided valuable analysis of bulk hydrogen diffusion in steels. In this work, we use a combination of CV and cryogenic-transfer APT for quantitative analysis of deuterium pickup in electrolytically charged pure Fe (ferrite) and a model austenitic Fe18Cr14Ni alloy without any second phase or defect trap sites. The high solubility and low diffusivity of hydrogen in austenite versus ferrite are highlighted to result in clear observable signatures in CV and cryogenic-transfer APT results. The remaining challenges and pathway for enabling quantitative analysis of hydrogen pick up in steels is also discussed. 
Electrochemical reactions for hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide production are essential for energy conversion to diminish energy crisis, but still lack efficient electrocatalysts. Development of non\-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and 2e oxygen reduction reaction to ease reaction kinetics is a challenging task. Integration of single components by employing easy strategies provides a key\-step towards the realization of highly active electrocatalysts. In this vein, MoSe2 owns catalytic active sites and high specific surface area but suffers from insufficient conductivity and high catalytic performance that noble\-metals provide. Herein, MoSe2 was used as a platform for the incorporation of manganese metallated porphyrin. The developed hybrid, namely MoSe2\-MnP, by the initial metal\-ligand coordination and the subsequent grafting with MnP was fully characterized and electrochemically assessed. The bifunctional electrocatalyst lowered the overpotential toward hydrogen evolution, improved reaction kinetics and charge transfer processes and was extremely stable after 10000 ongoing cycles. Simultaneously, rotating ring disk electrode analysis showed that oxygen reduction proceeds through the 2e pathway for the selective production of hydrogen peroxide with a high yield of 97 percent. The new facile modification route can be applied in diverse transition metal dichalcogenides and will help the development of new advanced functional materials. 
Analysis and understanding of the role of hydrogen in metals is a significant challenge for the future of materials science, and this is a clear objective of recent work in the atom probe tomography (APT) community. Isotopic marking by deuteration has often been proposed as the preferred route to enable quantification of hydrogen by APT. Zircaloy-4 was charged electrochemically with hydrogen and deuterium under the same conditions to form large hydrides and deuterides. Our results from a Zr hydride and a Zr deuteride highlight challenges associated to accurate quantification of hydrogen and deuterium, in particular associated to the overlap of peaks at low mass-to-charge ratio and of hydrogen/deuterium containing molecular ions. We discuss possible ways to ensure that appropriate information is extracted from APT analysis of hydrogen in a zirconium alloy systems that is important for nuclear power. 
Large scale implementation of electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen evolution requires cheap and efficient catalysts to replace expensive platinum. Molybdenum disulfide is one of the most promising alternative catalysts but its intrinsic activity is still inferior to platinum. There is therefore a need to explore new active site origins in molybdenum disulfide with ultrafast reaction kinetics and to understand their mechanisms. Here, we report a universal cold hydrogen plasma reduction method for synthesizing different single atoms sitting on two-dimensional monolayers. In case of molybdenum disulfide, we design and identify a new type of active site, i.e., unsaturated Mo single atoms on cogenetic monolayer molybdenum disulfide. The catalyst shows exceptional intrinsic activity with a Tafel slope of 35.1 mV dec-1 and a turnover frequency of ~10^3 s-1 at 100 mV, based on single flake microcell measurements. Theoretical studies indicate that coordinately unsaturated Mo single atoms sitting on molybdenum disulfide increase the bond strength between adsorbed hydrogen atoms and the substrates through hybridization, leading to fast hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics and superior hydrogen evolution activity. This work shines fresh light on preparing highly-efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting and other electrochemical processes, as well as provides a general method to synthesize single atoms on two-dimensional monolayers. 
In order for the widely discussed benefits of flow batteries for electrochemical energy storage to be applied at large scale, the cost of the electrochemical stack must come down substantially. One promising avenue for reducing stack cost is to increase the system power density while maintaining efficiency, enabling smaller stacks. Here we report on a membrane-less, hydrogen bromine laminar flow battery as a potential high power density solution. The membrane-less design enables power densities of 0.795 W cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, with a round-trip voltage efficiency of 92\% at 25\% of peak power. Theoretical solutions are also presented to guide the design of future laminar flow batteries. The high power density achieved by the hydrogen bromine laminar flow battery, along with the potential for rechargeable operation, will translate into smaller, inexpensive systems that could revolutionize the fields of large-scale energy storage and portable power systems. 
Perovskite photoelectrodes are being extensively studied in search for photocatalytic materials that can produce hydrogen through water splitting. The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of these materials is critically dependent on the electrochemical state of their surface. Here, we develop an embedded quantum-mechanical approach using the self-consistent continuum solvation (SCCS) model to predict the relation between band alignment, electrochemical stability, and photocatalytic activity taking into account the long-range polarization of the semiconductor electrode under electrical bias. Using this comprehensive model, we calculate the charge-voltage response of various reconstructions of a solvated SrTiO3 surface, revealing that interfacial charge trapping exerts primary control on the electrical response and surface stability of the photoelectrode. Our results provide a detailed molecular-level interpretation of the enhanced photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3 upon voltage-induced restructuring of the semiconductor-solution interface. 
Among various perovskite proton conducting oxides, Y-doped BaZrO3 perovskite is a promising material for electrochemical hydrogen devices due to the good chemical stability and higher proton conductivity at higher operating temperatures like 500-800 {\deg}C. For the practical application of the functional BaZrO3 proton conductor in the electrochemical hydrogen devices, its necessary to understand the isotopic effect of proton conductivity. To understand the isotopic effect of proton conductivity in the barium zirconates, in this study, the proton conductivity in the Ar, (Ar + 4% H2), (Ar + 4% D2), (Ar + H2O), (Ar + D2O), and O2 atmospheres were measured for two different compositions: BaZr0.9Y0.1O2.95 (BZY), and BaZr0.955Y0.03Co0.015O2.97 (BZYC) in the temperature range from 500 {\deg}C to 1000 {\deg}C. By comparing the obtained results, a significant difference in sinterability, conductivity, and the isotopic effect was observed due to the co-doping of the Co element in the BaZr1-xYxO3-a proton conductor. 
Laterally nanostructured surfaces give rise to a new dimension of understanding and improving electrochemical reactions. In this study, we present a peculiar mechanism appearing at a metal/insulator interface, which can significantly enhance the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) from water reduction by altering the local reaction conditions in two ways: facilitated adsorption of hydrogen on the metal catalyst surface and improved transfer of ions through the double layer. The mechanism is uncovered using electrodes consisting of well-defined nanometer-sized metal arrays (Au, Cu, Pt) embedded in an insulator layer (silicon nitride), varying various parameters of both the electrode (size of the metal patches, catalyst material) and the electrolyte (cationic species, cation concentration, pH). In addition, simulations of the electrochemical double layer are carried out, which support the elaborated mechanism. Knowledge of this mechanism will enable new design principles for novel composite electrocatalytic systems. 
Nonelectrochemical hydrogen peroxide direct synthesis (HPDS) under ambient conditions is an environmentally benign and energy-efficient process that produces a green oxidizer. Despite its industrial importance, the reaction mechanism of HPDS is still controversial, even for the prototypical catalyst Pd. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a comprehensive consideration of entropic and solvation effects reveal that the conventionally accepted Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism fails to explain why H2O2 production dominates over H2O production, which was experimentally reported. Inspired by the recently suggested heterolytic mechanism that involves electron and proton transfer at Pd catalysts, we propose a new electrochemical DFT model that is applicable for nonelectrochemical systems where a protonation intrinsically occurs. Our model is based on combining the Butler-Volmer equation and constant potential DFT with hybrid explicit-implicit solvent treatments. Application of this model to Pd(111) surfaces produces accurate descriptions of the activation barriers of both H2O2 and H2O production (within only ~0.1 eV of experimentally measured values). The heterolytic mechanism has a lower barrier for the protonation steps for H2O2 production than the nonelectrochemical hydrogenation steps, leading to advantageous kinetics for H2O2 production over H2O production. This work is the first theoretical and computational study supporting the heterolytic H2O2 production mechanism, and it resolves the unanswered discrepancies between previous experimental and DFT results. We expect that these results will readily help the systematic development of improved catalysts for H2O2 synthesis. 
While low-cost natural gas remains abundant, the energy content of this fuel can be utilized without greenhouse gas emissions through the production of molecular hydrogen and solid carbon via methane pyrolysis. In the absence of a carbon tax, methane pyrolysis is not economically competitive with current hydrogen production methods unless the carbon byproducts can be valorized. In this work, we assess the viability of the carbon byproduct produced from methane pyrolysis in molten salts as high-value-added anode or conductive additive for secondary Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Raman characterization and electrochemical differential capacity analysis demonstrate that the use of molten salt mixtures with catalytically-active FeCl3- or MnCl2 result in more graphitic carbon co-products. These graphitic carbons exhibit the best electrochemical performance (up to 272 mAh/g of reversible capacity) when used as Li-ion anodes. For all carbon samples studied here, disordered carbon domains and retained salt species trapped and/or intercalated into the carbon structure were identified by X-ray photoelectron and multinuclear solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The latter lead to reduced electrochemical activity and reversibility, and poorer rate performance compared to commercial carbon anodes. The electronic conductivity of the pyrolyzed carbons is found to be highly dependent on their purity, with the purest carbon exhibiting an electronic conductivity nearly on par with that of commercial carbon additives. These findings suggest that more effective removal of the salt catalyst could enable applications of these carbons in secondary batteries, providing a financial incentive for the large-scale implementation of methane pyrolysis for low-carbon hydrogen production. 
The current state of the art in direct water splitting in photo-electrochemical cells (PECs) is presented together with: (i) a case study of water splitting using a simple solar cell with the most efficient water splitting electrodes and (ii) a detailed mechanism analysis. Detailed analysis of the energy balance and efficiency of solar hydrogen production are presented. The role of hydrogen peroxide formation as an intermediate in oxygen evolution reaction is newly revealed and explains why an oxygen evolution is not taking place at the thermodynamically expected 1.23 V potential.   Solar hydrogen production with electrical-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 52% is demonstrated using a simple ~0.7%-efficient n-Si/Ni Schottky solar cell connected to a water electrolysis cell. This case study shows that separation of the processes of solar harvesting and electrolysis avoids photo-electrode corrosion and utilizes optimal electrodes for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions and achieves ~10% efficiency in light-to-hydrogen conversion with a standard 18% efficient household roof Si-solar cells. 
In recent years, various forms of nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) have emerged as an attractive group of diamond/graphite mixed-phase materials for a range of applications from electron emission sources to electrodes for neural interfacing. To tailor their properties for different uses, NCD surfaces can be terminated with various chemical functionalities, in particular hydrogen and oxygen, which shift the band edge positions and electron affinity values. While the band edge positions of chemically terminated single crystal diamond are well understood, the same is not true for nanocrystalline diamond, which has uncontrolled crystallographic surfaces with a variety of chemical states as well as graphitic grain boundary regions. In this work, the relative band edge positions of as-grown, hydrogen terminated, and oxygen terminated nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD) are determined using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), while the band bending is investigated using photoelectrochemical measurements. In contrast to the widely reported negative electrode affinity of hydrogen terminated single crystal diamond, our work demonstrates that hydrogen terminated N-UNCD exhibits a positive electron affinity owing to the increased surface and bulk defect densities. These findings elucidate the marked differences in electrochemical properties of hydrogen and oxygen terminated N-UNCD, such as the dramatic changes in electrochemical capacitance. 
Thousands of tons of isotopic mixtures are processed annually for heavy-water production and tritium decontamination. The existing technologies remain extremely energy intensive and require large capital investments. New approaches are needed to reduce the industry's footprint. Recently, micron-size crystals of graphene were shown to act as efficient sieves for hydrogen isotopes pumped through graphene electrochemically. Here we report a fully-scalable approach, using graphene obtained by chemical vapor deposition, which allows a proton-deuteron separation factor of ca. 8, despite cracks and imperfections. The energy consumption is projected to be orders of magnitude smaller with respect to existing technologies. A membrane based on 30 m2 of graphene, a readily accessible amount, could provide a heavy-water output comparable to that of modern plants. Even higher efficiency is expected for tritium separation. With no fundamental obstacles for scaling up, the technology's simplicity, efficiency and green credentials call for consideration by the nuclear and related industries. 
We designed solution-processed, flexible hybrid graphene flake/2H-MoS2 quantum dot (QD) heterostructures, showing enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with respect to their native individual components. The 2H-MoS2 QDs are produced through a scalable, environmentally friendly, one-step solvothermal approach from two-dimensional (2D) 2H-MoS2 flakes obtained by liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of their bulk counterpart in 2-Propanol. This QDs synthesis avoids the use of high boiling point and/or toxic solvents. Graphene flakes are produced by LPE of graphite in N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone. The electrochemical properties of 2H-MoS2 QDs and their HER-favorable chemical and electronic coupling with graphene enable to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm^2 at an overpotential of 136 mV, surpassing the performances of graphene flake/2H-MoS2 (1T-MoS2) flake heterostructures. Our approach provides a shortcut, viable and cost-effective method for enhancing the 2D materials electrocatalytic properties. 
The relative efficacy of electrochemical permeation (EP) and isothermal desorption spectroscopy (ITDS) methods for determining the hydrogen diffusivity is investigated using cold-rolled pure iron. The diffusivities determined from 13 first transient and 8 second transient EP experiments, evaluated using the conventional lag and breakthrough time methods, are compared to the results of 10 ITDS experiments. Results demonstrate that the average diffusivity is similar between the second EP transient and ITDS, which are distinctly increased relative to the first EP transient. However, the coefficient of variation for the ITDS experiments is reduced by 2 and 3-fold relative to the first and second EP transients, confirming the improved repeatability of ITDS diffusivity measurements. The source of the increased error in EP measurements is systematically evaluated, revealing an important influence of assumed electrochemical boundary conditions on the analysis and interpretation of EP experiments. 
Hydrogen embrittlement in 304L (18wt.% Cr, 8-10wt.% Ni) austenitic stainless steel (ASS) fabricated by laser powder-bed-fusion (LPBF) was investigated by tensile testing after electrochemical hydrogen pre-charging and compared to conventionally available 304L ASSs with two different processing histories, (i) casting plus annealing (CA) and (ii) CA plus thermomechanical treatment (TMT). It was revealed that hydrogen-charging led to a significant reduction in ductility for the CA sample, but only a small effect of hydrogen was observed for the LPBF and CA-TMT samples. Hydrogen-assisted cracking behavior was found to be strongly linked to strain-induced martensitic transformation. In addition, the amount of alpha' martensite was much higher in the CA sample than in other samples, suggesting that severe hydrogen embrittlement can be correlated with the low mechanical stability of austenite. Detailed microstructural characterization showed that low austenite stability of the CA sample was mainly attributed to the retained content of delta ferrite and the chemical inhomogeneity inside the gamma matrix (gamma close to delta has ~2 wt.% higher Cr but ~2 wt.% lower Ni), but TMT enhanced the chemical homogeneity and thus austenite stability. By contrast, the LPBF process led directly, i.e. without any thermomechanical treatment, to a fully austenitic structure with homogeneous elemental distribution in the ASS. These results confirmed that the presence of delta and the chemical inhomogeneity inside gamma matrix, which promoted the deformation-induced martensitic transformation and the associated H enrichment at the gamma-alpha' interface, was the primary reason for the severe H-assisted failure. 
The measurement of hydrogen induced changes on the electronic structure of transition metal oxides by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is a challenging endeavor, since the origin of the photoelectron cannot be unambiguously assigned to hydrogen. The H-induced electronic structure changes in tungsten trioxide have been known for more than 100 years, but are still being controversially debated. The controversy stems from the difficulty in disentangling effects due to hydrogenation from the effects of oxygen deficiencies. Using a membrane approach to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in combination with tuneable synchrotron radiation we measure simultaneously core levels and valence band up to a hydrogen pressure of 1000 mbar. Upon hydrogenation, the intensities of the W$^{5+}$ core level and a state close to the Fermi level increase following the pressure-composition isotherm curve of bulk H$_x$WO$_3$. Combining experimental data and density-functional theory the description of the hydrogen induced coloration by a proton polaron model is corroborated. Although hydrogen is the origin of the electronic structure changes near the Fermi edge, the valence band edge is now dominated by tungsten orbitals instead of oxygen as is the case for the pristine oxide having wider implication for its use as (photo-electrochemical) catalyst. 
A small, bimetallic particle in a hydrogen peroxide solution can propel itself by means of an electrocatalytic reaction. The swimming is driven by a flux of ions around the particle. We model this process for the presence of a monovalent salt, where reaction-driven proton currents induce salt ion currents. A theory for thin diffuse layers is employed, which yields nonlinear, coupled transport equations. The boundary conditions include a compact Stern layer of adsorbed ions. Electrochemical processes on the particle surface are modeled with a first order reaction of the Butler-Volmer type. The equations are solved numerically for the swimming speed. An analytical approximation is derived under the assumption that the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide occurs mainly without inducing an electric current. We find that the swimming speed increases linearly with hydrogen peroxide concentration for small concentrations. The influence of ion diffusion on the reaction rate can lead to a concave shape of the function of speed vs. hydrogen peroxide concentration. The compact layer of ions on the particle diminishes the reaction rate and consequently reduces the speed. Our results are consistent with published experimental data. 
We present a techno-economic optimization model for evaluating the design and operation of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, crucial for hydrogen production powered by variable renewable electricity. This model integrates a 0-D physics representation of the electrolyzer stack, complete mass and energy balances, operational constraints, and empirical data on use-dependent degradation. Utilizing a decomposition approach, the model predicts optimal electrolyzer size, operation, and necessary hydrogen storage to satisfy baseload demands across various technology and electricity price scenarios. Analysis for 2022 shows that including degradation effects raises the levelized cost of hydrogen from \$4.56/kg to \$6.60/kg and decreases stack life to two years. However, projections for 2030 anticipate a significant reduction in costs to approximately \$2.50/kg due to lower capital expenses, leading to larger stacks, extended lifetimes, and less hydrogen storage. This approach is adaptable to other electrochemical systems relevant for decarbonization. 
Two-dimensional transition metal-dichalcogenides are emerging as efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, only the edge sites of their trigonal prismatic phase show HER-electrocatalytic properties, while the basal plane, which is absent of defective/unsaturated sites, is inactive. Here, we tackle the key challenge that is increasing the number of electrocatalytic sites by designing and engineering heterostructures composed of single-/few-layer MoSe2 flakes and carbon nanomaterials (graphene or single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)) produced by solution processing. The electrochemical coupling between the materials that comprise the heterostructure effectively enhances the HER-electrocatalytic activity of the native MoSe2 flakes. The optimization of the mass loading of MoSe2 flakes and their electrode assembly via monolithic heterostructure stacking provided a cathodic current density of 10mAcm-2 at overpotential of 100mV, a Tafel slope of 63mVdec-1 and an exchange current density (j0) of 0.203 Acm-2. In addition, electrode thermal annealing in a hydrogen environment and chemical bathing in n-butyllithium are exploited to texturize the basal planes of the MoSe2 flakes (through Se-vacancies creation) and to achieve in situ semiconducting-to-metallic phase conversion, respectively, thus they activate new HER-electrocatalytic sites. The as-engineered electrodes show a 4.8-fold enhancement of j0 and a decrease in the Tafel slope to 54mVdec-1. 
Molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) production by electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is being actively explored for non-precious-metal based electrocatalysts that are earth-abundant and low cost like MoS$_2$. Although it is acid-stable, its applicability is limited by catalytically inactive basal plane, poor electrical transport and inefficient charge transfer at the interface. Therefore, the present work examines its bilayer van der Waals heterostructure (vdW HTS). The second constituent monolayer Boron Phosphide (BP) is advantageous as an electrode material owing to its chemical stability in both oxygen and water environments. Here, we have performed first-principles based calculations under the framework of density functional theory (DFT) for HER in an electrochemical double layer model with the BP monolayer, MoS$_2$/BP and MoSSe/BP vdW HTSs. The climbing image nudged elastic band method (CI-NEB) has been employed to determine the minimum energy pathways for Tafel and Heyrovsky reactions. The calculations yield that Tafel reaction shows no reaction barrier. Thereafter, for Heyrovsky reaction, we have obtained low reaction barrier in the vdW HTSs as compared to that in the BP monolayer. Subsequently, we have observed no significant difference in the reaction profile of MoS$_2$/BP and MoSSe/BP vdW HTSs in case of high coverage (25 %) and 1/3 H$^+$ concentration (conc.). However, in the case of small coverage (11 %) and 1/3 H$^+$ conc., MoSSe/BP shows feasible Heyrovsky reaction with no reaction barrier. Finally, on comparing the coverages with 1/4 H$^+$ conc., we deduce high coverage with low conc. and low coverage with high conc. to be apt for HER via Heyrovsky reaction path. 
Graphene is of interest in the development of next-generation electronics due to its high electron mobility, flexibility and stability. However, graphene transistors have poor on/off current ratios because of the absence of a bandgap. One approach to introduce an energy gap is to use hydrogenation reaction, which changes graphene into insulating graphane with sp3 bonding. Here we show that an electric field can be used to control conductor-to-insulator transitions in microscale graphene via a reversible electrochemical hydrogenation in an organic liquid electrolyte containing dissociative hydrogen ions. The fully hydrogenated graphene exhibits a lower limit sheet resistance of 200 Gohm/sq, resulting in graphene field-effect transistors with on/off current ratios of 10^8 at room temperature. The devices also exhibit high endurance, with up to one million switching cycles. Similar insulating behaviours are also observed in bilayer graphene, while trilayer graphene remains highly conductive after the hydrogenation. Changes in the graphene lattice, and the transformation from sp2 to sp3 hybridization, is confirmed by in-situ Raman spectroscopy, supported by first-principles calculations. 
Proton-conducting oxides are potential materials for electrochemical devices such as fuel cells, hydrogen pumps, hydrogen sensors, and the tritium purification and recovery system in nuclear fusion reactors. The hydrogen concentration in oxide materials is important, but its precise measurement is difficult. In this study, thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) was used to investigate hydrogen dissolution and release behavior in proton-conducting oxides, yttrium (Y), and cobalt (Co) doped barium-zirconates in the temperature range of 673-1273 K using deuterium (D2) and heavy water (D2O). Specimens were prepared with conventional powder metallurgy: the powder of three zirconates, BaZr0.9Y0.1O3-a (BZY), BaZr0.955Y0.03Co0.015O3-a (BZYC), and CaZr0.9In0.1O2.95 (CZI) was pressed into discs and fired in the air at 1873 K for 20 h. The densities of the sintered BZY, BZYC, and CZI specimens were 98 percent, 99.7 percent, and 99.5 percent of the theoretical densities respectively. XRD, SEM, and EDX were performed for the structural and morphological analysis of the sintered samples. From TDS measurement, a similar trend of temperature-dependent hydrogen solubility was obtained for all samples compared to the tritium imaging plate (TIP) methods literature data of HT- and DTO-exposed samples. To compare the experimental results of the deuterium desorption profile derived by TDS analysis, the simulation code of the tritium migration analysis program, version 4 (TMAP4) was employed. 
Proton-conducting oxides have potential applications in hydrogen sensors, hydrogen pumps, and other electrochemical devices including the tritium purification and recovery systems of nuclear fusion reactors. Although the distribution of hydrogen (H) in such oxide materials is an important aspect, its precise measurement is difficult. In the present study, the hydrogen solubility and diffusivity behavior of BaZr0.9Y0.1O2.95 (BZY), BaZr0.955Y0.03Co0.015O2.97 (BZYC), and CaZr0.9In0.1O2.95 (CZI) were studied using tritiated heavy water vapor i.e., DTO (~2 kPa, tritium (T) = 0.1%) by converting the photostimulated luminescence (PSL) values of the imaging plate (IP). The samples were exposed to DTO vapor at 673 K for 2 h or at 873 K for 1 h. The disc-shaped oxide specimens (diameter ~7.5 mm; thickness ~2.3 mm; theoretical density (TD) > 98 %) were prepared by conventional powder metallurgy. The IP images of the specimen surfaces of all the three materials T-exposed revealed that BZY showed the most uniform T distribution with the highest tritium activity. The cross-sectional T concentration profiles of the cut specimens showed that T diffused deeper into BZY and BZYC than into CZI. The hydrogen solubility and diffusivity in the CZI specimen were lower than that in the BZY and BZYC specimens. This suggested that barium zirconates were more favorable proton conductors than calcium zirconates. 
A uniformly coated MoS2/Carbon-nanocomposite with three-dimensional hierarchical architecture based on carbonized bacterial cellulose (CBC) nanofibers is synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal method followed by thermal annealing at 700 {\deg}C in Ar atmosphere. Strong hydrogen bonds between the Mo precursor and the BC nanofibers are found to be crucial for the in-situ growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the nanofibers during hydrothermal process. The unique structure was maintained and the connection between MoS2 and nanofibers were strengthened in the sintering process, leading to an improved stability of the resulting nanocomposite upon electrochemical cycling. The low-cost and environmentally friendly 3D web-like structure enables binder-free and carbon-free electrodes for lithium-ion batteries, which exhibit high specific discharge capacities up to 1140 mAh/g at the C-rate of 1 C without significant capacity fading for over 50 cycles. The porous conductive hierarchical structure of the composite endows excellent rate performance by avoiding the aggregation of the MoS2 nanosheets and by accommodating mechanical stress which appears upon electrochemical cycling. 
Intraocular pressure, resulting from the balance of aqueous humor (AH) production and drainage, is the only approved treatable risk factor in glaucoma. AH production is determined by the concurrent function of ionic pumps and aquaporins in the ciliary processes but their individual contribution is difficult to characterize experimentally. In this work, we propose a novel unified modeling and computational framework for the finite element simulation of the role of the main ionic pumps involved in AH secretion, namely, the sodium potassium pump, the calcium-sodium pump, the anion channel and the hydrogenate-sodium pump. The theoretical model is developed at the cellular scale and is based on the coupling between electrochemical and fluid-dynamical transmembrane mechanisms characterized by a novel description of the electric pressure exerted by the ions on the intrachannel fluid that includes electrochemical and osmotic corrections. Considering a realistic geometry of the ionic pumps, the proposed model is demonstrated to correctly predict their functionality as a function of (1) the permanent electric charge density over the channel pump surface; (2) the osmotic gradient coefficient; (3) the stoichiometric ratio between the ionic pump currents enforced at the inlet and outlet sections of the channel. In particular, theoretical predictions of the transepithelial membrane potential for each simulated pump/channel allow us to perform a first significant model comparison with experimental data for monkeys. This is a significant step for future multidisciplinary studies on the action of molecules on AH production. 
Lack of fast and strong actuators to drive microsystems is well recognized. Electrochemical actuators are considered attractive for many applications but they have long response time (minutes) due to slow gas termination. Here an electrochemical actuator is presented for which the response time can be as short as 1 ms. The alternating polarity water electrolysis is used to drive the device. In this process only nanobubbles are formed. The gas in nanobubbles can be terminated fast due to surface assisted reaction between hydrogen and oxygen that happens at room temperature. The working chamber of the actuator contains concentric titanium electrodes; it has a diameter of 500 um and a height of 8 um. The chamber is sealed by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane of 30 um thick. The device is characterized by an interferometer and a fast camera. Cyclic operation at frequency up to 667 Hz with a stroke of about 30% of the chamber volume is demonstrated. The cycles repeat themselves with high precision providing the volume strokes in picoliter range. Controlled explosions in the chamber can push the membrane up to 90 um. 
Widespread adoption of high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs) and HT-PEM electrochemical hydrogen pumps (HT-PEM ECHPs) requires models and computational tools that provide accurate scale-up and optimization. Knowledge-based modeling has limitations as it is time consuming and requires information about the system that is not always available (e.g., material properties and interfacial behavior between different materials). Data-driven modeling on the other hand, is easier to implement, but often necessitates large datasets that could be difficult to obtain. In this contribution, knowledge-based modeling and data-driven modeling are uniquely combined by implementing a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) approach. A knowledge-based model originally developed for a HT-PEMFC was used to generate simulated data (887,735 points) and used to pretrain a neural network source model. Furthermore, the source model developed for HT-PEMFCs was successfully applied to HT-PEM ECHPs - a different electrochemical system that utilizes similar materials to the fuel cell. Experimental datasets from both HT-PEMFCs and HT-PEM ECHPs with different materials and operating conditions (~50 points each) were used to train 8 target models via FSL. Models for the unseen data reached high accuracies in all cases (rRMSE between 1.04 and 3.73% for HT-PEMCs and between 6.38 and 8.46% for HT-PEM ECHPs). 
Experiments have shown that pitting corrosion can develop in aluminum surfaces at potentials $> -0.5$ V relative to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). Until recently, the onset of pitting corrosion in aluminum has not been rigorously explored at an atomistic scale because of the difficulty of incorporating a voltage into density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We introduce the Quantum Continuum Approximation (QCA) which self-consistently couples explicit DFT calculations of the metal-insulator and insulator-solution interfaces to continuum Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic distributions describing the bulk of the insulating region. By decreasing the number of atoms necessary to explicitly simulate with DFT by an order of magnitude, QCA makes the first-principles prediction of the voltage of realistic electrochemical interfaces feasible. After developing this technique, we apply QCA to predict the formation energy of chloride atoms inserting into oxygen vacancies in Al(111)/$\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) interfaces as a function of applied voltage. We predict that chloride insertion is only favorable in systems with a grain boundary in the Al$_2$O$_3$ for voltages $> -0.2$ V (SHE). Our results roughly agree with the experimentally demonstrated onset of corrosion, demonstrating QCA's utility in modeling realistic electrochemical systems at reasonable computational cost. 
The design of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the key for molecular hydrogen (H2) production from electrochemical water splitting. Transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2), most notably group-6 MX2 (e.g., MoS2 and WS2), are appealing catalysts for the HER alternative to the best, but highly expensive, Pt-group elements. However, their HER activity is typically restricted to their edge sites rather than their basal plane. Furthermore, their semiconducting properties hinder an efficient electron transfer to the catalytic sites, which impedes a high rate of H2 production. Herein, we exploit liquid-phase exfoliation-produced metallic (1H, 2H and 3R) NbS2 nanoflakes, belonging to the class of metallic layered group-5 MX2, to overcome the abovementioned limitations. Both chemical treatment with hygroscopic Li salt and electrochemical in operando self-nanostructuring are exploited to improve the NbS2 nanoflake HER activity. The combination of NbS2 with other MX2, in our case MoSe2, also provides heterogeneous catalysts accelerating the HER kinetics of the individual counterparts. The designed NbS2-based catalysts exhibit an overpotential at a cathodic current of 10 mA cm-2 (n10) as low as 0.10 and 0.22 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the HER activity of the NbS2-based catalysts is also superior to those of the Pt/C benchmark at current densities higher than 80 mA cm-2. Our work provides general guidelines for a scalable and cost-effective exploitation of NbS2, as well as the entire MX2 portfolio, for attaining a viable H2 production through electrochemical routes. 
Efficient anti-reflection coatings (ARC) improve the light collection and thereby increase the current output of solar cells. By simple electrochemical etching of the Si wafer, porous silicon (PS) layers with excellent broadband anti-reflection properties can be fabricated. In this work, ageing of graded PS has been studied using Spectroscopic Ellipsometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. During oxidation of PS elements such as pure Si (Si$^0$), Si$_2$O (Si$^+$), SiO (Si$^{2+}$), Si$_2$O$_3$ (Si$^{3+}$), and SiO$_2$ (Si$^{4+}$) are present. In addition both hydrogen and carbon is introduced to the PS in the form of Si$_3$SiH and CO. The oxide grows almost linearly with time when exposed to oxygen, from an average thickness of 0 - 3.8 nm for the surface PS. The oxidation is then correlated to the optical stability of multi-layered PS ARCs. It is found that even after extensive oxidation, the changes in the optical properties of the PS structures are small. 
Microscopy of polymer electrolyte membranes that have undergone operation under fuel cell conditions, have revealed a well defined band of platinum in the membrane. Here, we propose a physics based model that captures the mechanism of platinum precipitation in the polymer electrolyte membrane. While platinum is observed throughout the membrane, the preferential growth of platinum at the band of platinum is dependent on the electrochemical potential distribution in the membrane. In this paper, the location of the platinum band is calculated as a function of the gas concentration at the cathode and anode, gas diffusion coefficients and solubility constants of the gases in the membrane, which are functions of relative humidity. Under H2/N2 conditions the platinum band is located near the cathode-membrane interface, as the oxygen concentration in the cathode gas stream increases and/or the hydrogen concentration in the anode gas stream decreases, the band moves towards the anode. The model developed in this paper agrees with the set of experimental data on the platinum band location and the platinum particle distribution and size. 
Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is a common physicochemical effect to elucidate complicated microscopic reaction mechanism in biological, chemical and physical systems. Especially, the exchange of hydrogen to deuterium is a standard approach to investigate kinetics and pathways of a wide spectrum of key reactions involving proton transfer. However, KIE in electrocatalysis is still challenge. One main reason is owing to the high sensitivity to impurities in electrochemical systems. Aiming to establish an appropriate approach to observe KIE in electrocatalysis, we investigated KIE in electrocatalysis by using fully deuterated ultrapure electrolytes. With these electrolytes, we studied oxygen reduction reaction with platinum catalyst, which is well-known to be sensitive to impurity, as the model systems. In conclusion, the electrode processes in these systems can be strongly influenced by a purity of a selected deuterated electrolyte, especially in case of alkaline conditions. Therefore a highly pure deuterated electrolyte is indispensable to study microscopic electrode processes of electrocatalysis by analyzing KIE. This work shows a key criterion and methods to observe a reliable KIE in electrocatalytic systems, and therefore, provides a general approach to investigate complicated multielectron- and multiproton-transfer processes using not only standard electrochemical technique but also surface sensitive spectrometry. 
Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) play important roles in various physiological processes (e.g., phagocytosis) and pathological conditions (e.g., cancer). The primary ROS/RNS, viz., hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite ion, nitric oxide, and nitrite ion, can be oxidized at different electrode potentials and therefore detected and quantified by electroanalytical techniques. Nanometer-sized electrochemical probes are especially suitable for measuring ROS/RNS in single cells and cellular organelles. In this article, we survey recent advances in localized measurements of ROS/RNS inside single cells and discuss several methodological issues, including optimization of nanoelectrode geometry, precise positioning of an electrochemical probe inside a cell, and interpretation of electroanalytical data. 
We discuss problems associated with the notion of pH in heterogeneous systems. For homogeneous systems, standardization protocols lead to a well defined quantity, which although different from S\o rensen's original idea of pH, is well reproducible and has become accepted as the measure of the ``hydrogen potential". On the other hand, for heterogeneous systems, pH defined in terms of the chemical part of the electrochemical activity is thermodynamically inconsistent and runs afoul of the Gibbs-Guggenheim principle that forbids splitting of the electrochemical potential into separate chemical and electrostatic parts -- since only the sum of two has any thermodynamic meaning. The problem is particularly relevant for modern simulation methods which involve charge regulation of proteins, polyelectrolytes, nanoparticles, colloidal suspensions etc. In this paper we show that titration isotherms calculated using semi-grand canonical simulations can be very different from the ones obtained using canonical reactive Monte Carlo simulations. 
Precious-metal-free spinel oxide electrocatalysts are promising candidates for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline fuel cells. In this theory-driven study, we use joint density-functional theory in tandem with supporting electrochemical measurements to identify a novel theoretical pathway for the ORR on cubic Co3O4 nanoparticle electrocatalysts. This pathway aligns more closely with experimental results than previous models. The new pathway employs the cracked adsorbates *(OH)(O) and *(OH)(OH), which, through hydrogen bonding, induce spectator surface *H. This results in an onset potential closely matching experimental values, in stark contrast to the traditional ORR pathway, which keeps adsorbates intact and overestimates the onset potential by 0.7 V. Finally, we introduce electrochemical strain spectroscopy (ESS), a groundbreaking strain analysis technique. ESS combines ab initio calculations with experimental measurements to validate proposed reaction pathways and pinpoint rate-limiting steps. 
Neuromorphic devices have gained significant attention as potential building blocks for the next generation of computing technologies owing to their ability to emulate the functionalities of biological nervous systems. The essential components in artificial neural network such as synapses and neurons are predominantly implemented by dedicated devices with specific functionalities. In this work, we present a gate-controlled transition of neuromorphic functions between artificial neurons and synapses in monolayer graphene transistors that can be employed as memtransistors or synaptic transistors as required. By harnessing the reliability of reversible electrochemical reactions between C atoms and hydrogen ions, the electric conductivity of graphene transistors can be effectively manipulated, resulting in high on/off resistance ratio, well-defined set/reset voltage, and prolonged retention time. Overall, the on-demand switching of neuromorphic functions in a single graphene transistor provides a promising opportunity to develop adaptive neural networks for the upcoming era of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
Advanced materials for electrocatalytic and photoelectrochemical water splitting are central to the area of renewable energy. Here, we developed a solvothermal synthesis of MoS2 nanoparticles selectively on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets suspended in solution. The resulting MoS2/RGO hybrid material possessed nanoscopic few-layer MoS2 structures with abundant exposed edges stacked onto graphene, in strong contrast to large aggregated MoS2 particles grown freely in solution without GO. The MoS2/RGO hybrid exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to other MoS2 catalysts. A Tafel slope of ~ 41 mV/decade was measured for MoS2 catalysts in HER for the first time, far exceeding the activity of previous MoS2 owing to the abundant catalytic edge sites of MoS2 nanoparticles and excellent electrical coupling to the underlying graphene network. The ~ 41 mV/decade Tafel slope suggested the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for MoS2 catalyzed HER, with electrochemical desorption of hydrogen as the rate-limiting step. 
Hydrogen fuel is an ideal energy source to replace the traditional fossil fuels because of its high energy density and renewability. Electrochemical water splitting is also regarded as a sustainable, cleaning and eco-friendly method for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but a cheaper, earth-abundant and similarly efficient alternative to Pt as an HER catalyst cannot still be discovered. Recently, 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) are demonstrated to greatly enhance the HER activity. Herein, our work provides an insight into the recent advances in 2D TMDs-based HER following the composition-characterisation-construction guideline. After the background introduction, several research outputs based on 2D TMDs as well as the comprehensive analysis on the modulation strategies of 2D TMDs, for the purposes of increasing the active sites, improving the intrinsic activity and altering the electronic states. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges of 2D TMDs electrocatalysts are briefly featured. 
Large scale production of hydrogen by electrochemical water splitting is considered as a promising technology to address critical energy challenges caused by the extensive use of fossil fuels. Although nonprecious nickel-based catalysts work well at low current densities, they need large overpotentials at high current densities that hinders their potential applications in practical industry. Here we report a hydroxide-mediated nickel based electrocatalyst for high current density hydrogen evolution, which delivers a current density of 1000 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 98 mV. Combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy and high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show charge redistribution of nickel sites caused by Mo and surface FeOx clusters, which can stabilize the surface nickel hydroxide at high current densities for promoting water dissociation step. Such catalyst is synthesized at the metre scale and shows a current density of 500 mA cm-2 at 1.56 V in the overall water splitting, which demonstrate its potential for practical use. This work highlights a charge-engineering strategy for rational design of catalysts that work well at high current densities. 
The development of active catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) made from low-cost materials constitutes a crucial challenge in the utilization of hydrogen energy. Earth-abundant molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) has been discovered recently with good activity and stability for HER. In this report, we employed the hydrothermal technique for MoS$_2$ synthesis which is a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach and has the potential for future mass production. To investigate the structure-property relationship, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and various electrochemical characterizations have been conducted. A strong correlation between the material structure and the HER performance has been observed. Moreover, machine-learning (ML) techniques were built and subsequently used within a Bayesian Optimization framework to validate the optimal parameter combinations for synthesizing high-quality MoS$_2$ catalyst within the limited parameter space. The model will be able to guide the wet chemical synthesis of MoS$_2$ and produce the most effective HER catalyst eventually. 
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a key process in electrochemical water splitting. To lower the cost and environmental impact of this process, it is highly motivated to develop electrocatalysts with low or no content of noble metals. Here we report on a novel and ingenious synthesis of hybrid PtxNi1-x electrocatalysts in the form of a nanoparticle-necklace structure named nanotrusses, with very low noble metal content. The nanotruss structure possesses important features, such as good conductivity, high surface area, strong interlinking and substrate adhesion, which renders for an excellent HER activity. Specifically, the best performing Pt0.05Ni0.95 sample, demonstrates a Tafel slope of 30 mV dec-1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, and an overpotential of 20 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 with high stability. The impressive catalytic performance is further rationalized in a theoretical study, which provides insight into the mechanism for how such small platinum content can allow for close-to-optimal adsorption energies for hydrogen. 
We use a unique combination of electrochemical techniques to elucidate the dependency of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and absorption on pH and overpotential for iron and nickel. Impedance spectroscopy shows the dominance of the Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction pathway, challenging the common consideration of Volmer-Tafel dominance. Polarization slopes agree with the Volmer or Heyrovsky rate-determining step, with limitations at high overpotential. The evolution of steady-state permeation current density with overpotential is rationalised through newly-developed theory. Surface activity and absorption trends are captured. Combined with modelling, this work provides a path for quantifying hydrogen uptake and establishing an equivalent fugacity for aqueous electrolytes. 
Electrochemical oxidation-reduction of radicals is a green and environmentally friendly approach to generating fuels. These reactions, however, suffer from sluggish kinetics due to a low local concentration of radicals around the electrocatalyst. A large electrode potential can enhance the fuel generation efficiency via enhancing the radical concentration around the electrocatalyst sites, but this comes at the cost of electricity. Here, we report about a 45 percent saving in energy to achieve an electrochemical hydrogen generation rate of 10 mA per cm2 through localized electric field-induced enhancement in the reagent concentration (LEFIRC) at laser-induced periodic surface structured (LIPSS) electrodes. The finite element model is used to simulate the spatial distribution of the electric field to understand the effects of LIPSS geometric parameters in field localization. When the LIPSS patterned electrodes are used as substrates to support Pt-C and RuO2 electrocatalysts, the overpotentials for HER and OER are decreased by 40 and 25 percent, respectively. Moreover, the capability of the LIPSS-patterned electrodes to operate at significantly reduced energy is also demonstrated in a range of electrolytes including alkaline, acidic, neutral, and seawater. Importantly, when two LIPSS patterned electrodes were assembled as the anode and cathode into a cell, it requires 330 mVs of lower electric potential with enhanced stability over a similar cell made of pristine electrodes to drive a current density of 10 mA/cm2. This work demonstrates a physical and versatile approach of electrode surface patterning to boost electrocatalytic fuel generation performance and can be applied to any metal and semiconductor catalysts for a range of electrochemical reactions. 
The electrochemical permeation test is one of the most used methods for characterising hydrogen diffusion in metals. The flux of hydrogen atoms registered in the oxidation cell might be fitted to obtain apparent diffusivities. The magnitude of this coefficient has a decisive influence on the kinetics of fracture or fatigue phenomena assisted by hydrogen and depends largely on hydrogen retention in microstructural traps. In order to improve the numerical fitting of diffusion coefficients, a permeation test has been reproduced using FEM simulations considering two approaches: a continuum 1D model in which the trap density, binding energy and the input lattice concentrations are critical variables and a polycrystalline model where trapping at grain boundaries is simulated explicitly including a segregation factor and a diffusion coefficient different from that of the interior of the grain. Results show that the continuum model captures trapping delay, but it should be modified to model the trapping influence on the steady state flux. Permeation behaviour might be classified according to different regimes depending on deviation from Fickian diffusion. Polycrystalline synthetic permeation shows a strong influence of segregation on output flux magnitude. This approach is able to simulate also the short-circuit diffusion phenomenon. The comparison between different grain sizes and grain boundary thicknesses by means of the fitted apparent diffusivity shows the relationships between the registered flux and the characteristic parameters of traps. 
The observation of extraordinarily high conductivity in delafossite-type PdCoO2 is of great current interest, and there is some evidence that electrons behave like a fluid when flowing in bulk crystals of PdCoO2. Thus, this material is an ideal platform for the study of the electron transfer processes in heterogeneous reactions. Here, we report the use of bulk single crystal PdCoO2 as a promising electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). An overpotential of only 31 mV results in a current density of 10 mA cm^(-2), accompanied by high long-term stability. We have precisely determined that the crystal surface structure is modified after electrochemical activation with the formation of strained Pd nanoclusters in the surface layer. These nanoclusters exhibit reversible hydrogen sorption and desorption, creating more active sites for hydrogen access. The bulk PdCoO2 single crystal with ultra-high conductivity, which acts as a natural substrate for the Pd nanoclusters, provides a high-speed channel for electron transfer 
Observing solute hydrogen (H) in matter is a formidable challenge, yet, enabling quantitative imaging of H at the atomic-scale is critical to understand its deleterious influence on the mechanical strength of many metallic alloys that has resulted in many catastrophic failures of engineering parts and structures. Here, we report on the APT analysis of hydrogen (H) and deuterium (D) within the nanostructure of an ultra-high strength steel with high resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. Cold drawn, severely deformed pearlitic steel wires (Fe-0.98C-0.31Mn-0.20Si-0.20Cr-0.01Cu-0.006P-0.007S wt.%, {\epsilon}=3.1) contains cementite decomposed during the pre-deformation of the alloy and ferrite. We find H and D within the decomposed cementite, and at some interfaces with the surrounding ferrite. To ascertain the origin of the H/D signal obtained in APT, we explored a series of experimental workflows including cryogenic specimen preparation and cryogenic-vacuum transfer from the preparation into a state-of-the-art atom probe. Our study points to the critical role of the preparation, i.e. the possible saturation of H-trapping sites during electrochemical polishing, how these can be alleviated by the use of an outgassing treatment, cryogenic preparation and transfer prior to charging. Accommodation of large amounts of H in the under-stoichiometric carbide likely explains the resistance of pearlite against hydrogen embrittlement. 
Pt electrocatalytic nanoparticles were deposited onto hybrid carriers composed of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-transition metal hexacyanoferrate (Prussian Blue-PB) and the resulting system's electrochemical activity was investigated during oxygen reduction reaction in acidic solution. The Prussian Blue -utilizing and Pt nanoparticle-containing materials were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and electrochemical diagnostic techniques such as cyclic voltammetry and rotating ring-disk voltammetry. Application of rGO carriers modified with Prussian Blue as matrices (supports) for Pt catalytic centers does not change practically the potential of electroreduction of oxygen in 0.5 mol dm-3 H2SO4 (under rotating disk voltammetric conditions) relative to the behavior of the analogous PB-free system. What is even more important that, due to the presence of the polynuclear cyanoferrate modifier, the amounts of the undesirable hydrogen peroxide intermediate are significantly decreased (at ring in the rotating ring-disk voltammetry). The results are consistent with the bifunctional mechanism in which oxygen reduction is initiated at Pt centers and the hydrogen peroxide intermediate is reductively decomposed at reactive PB-modified rGO supports. 
The high-throughput scalable production of cheap, efficient and durable electrocatalysts that work well at high current densities demanded by industry is a great challenge for the large-scale implementation of electrochemical technologies. Here we report the production of a 2D MoS2-based ink-type electrocatalyst by a scalable top-down exfoliation technique followed by a simple heat treatment. The catalyst shows a high current density of 1000 mA cm^-2 at an overpotential of 454 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) without the need of iR correction, as well as good stability over 24 hours. Using the same method, we have, for the first time, produced a cheap MoS2 mineral-based catalyst and found that it had an excellent performance for high-current-density HER. Noteworthy, production rate of this MoS2-based catalyst is one to two orders of magnitude higher than those previously reported. In addition, the price of the MoS2 mineral is five orders of magnitude lower than commercial Pt catalysts, making the MoS2 mineral-based catalyst cheap, and the ink-type catalyst dispersions can be easily integrated with other technologies for large-scale catalyst electrode preparation. These advantages indicate the huge potentials of this method and mineral-based cheap and abundant natural resources as catalysts in the electrochemical technologies. 
Research towards the production of renewable chemicals for fuel and energy industries has found lignin valorization as key. With a high carbon content and aromaticity, a fine-tuning of the depolymerization process is required to convert lignin into valuable chemicals. In context, model compounds have been used to understand the electrocatalyzed depolymerization for mimicking the typical linkages of lignin. In this investigation, 2-phenoxyacetophenone, a model compound for lignin \b{eta}-O-4 linkage, was electro-catalytically hydrogenated (ECH) in distinct three-electrode setups: an open and a membrane cell. A deep eutectic solvent based on ethylene-glycol and choline chloride was used to pursue sustainable routes to dissolve lignin. Copper was used as electrocatalyst due to the economic feasibility and low activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a side reaction of ECH. By varying the cell type, we demonstrate a simple ECH route for the generation of different monomers and oligomers from lignin. Gas chromatography of the products revealed a higher content of carbonyl groups in those using the membrane cell, whereas the open cell produced mostly hydroxyl-end chemicals. Aiming at high value-added products, our results disclose the cell type influence on electrochemical reductive depolymerization of lignin. This approach encompasses cheap transition metal electrodes and sustainable solvents. 
Porous electrodes were developed using laser powder bed fusion of Inconel 718 lattice structures and electrodeposition of a porous nickel catalytic layer. Laser energy densities of ~83-333 J/m were used to fabricate ~500 um thick electrodes made of body centered cubic unit cells of 200-500 um and strut thicknesses of 100-200 um. Unit cells of 500 um and strut thickness of 200 um were identified as optimum. Despite small changes in feature sizes by the energy input, the porosity of >50% and pore size of ~100 um did not change. In a subsequent step, we used nickel electrodeposition to create smaller scale pores on the electrode. The electrochemical performance of the electrodes for hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) was evaluated in a three-electrode setup. For HER, a much larger maximum current density of ~ -372 mA/cm2 at a less negative potential of ~-0.4 V vs RHE (potential against reversible hydrogen electrode) was obtained in the nickel-coated samples, as compared to -240 mA/cm2 at ~-0.6 V in the bare one, indicating superior performance of the coated sample. Conversely, OER exhibited minor performance differences upon application of the coating, indicating insignificant dependence of OER to surface composition and available surface. 
The evolution of electrogenerated gas bubbles during water electrolysis can significantly hamper the overall process efficiency. Promoting the departure of electrochemically generated bubbles during (water) electrolysis is therefore beneficial. For a single bubble, a departure from the electrode surface occurs when buoyancy wins over the downward-acting forces (e.g. contact, Marangoni, and electric forces). In this work, the dynamics of a pair of H$_2$ bubbles produced during hydrogen evolution reaction in 0.5 M H$_2$SO$_4$ using dual platinum micro-electrode system is systematically studied by varying the electrode distance and the cathodic potential. By combining high-speed imaging and electrochemical analysis, we demonstrate the importance of bubble-bubble interactions for the departure process. We show that bubble coalescence may lead to substantially earlier bubble departure as compared to buoyancy effects alone, resulting in considerably higher reaction rates at constant potential. However, due to continued mass input and conservation of momentum repeated coalescence events with bubbles close to the electrode may drive departed bubbles back to the surface beyond a critical current, which increases with the electrode spacing. The latter leads to the resumption of bubble growth near the electrode surface, followed by buoyancy-driven departure. While less favourable at small electrode spacing, this configuration proves to be very beneficial at larger separations increasing the mean current up to 2.4 times compared to a single electrode under the conditions explored in this study. 
Very recently, it has been shown that an abundant material, polymeric carbon nitride, can produce hydrogen from water under visible-light irradiation in the presence of a sacrificial donor [1]. We will present here the preparation and characterization of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) films on semiconducting substrates by thermal condensation of dicyandiamide precursor under inert gas conditions. Structural and surface morphological studies of the carbon nitride films suggest a high porosity of g-C3N4 thin film consisting of a network of nanocrystallites. Photo-electrochemical investigations show upon cathodic polarization light-induced hydrogen evolution for a wide range of proton concentrations in the aqueous electrolyte. Additionally, Synchrotron radiation based photoelectron spectroscopy has been applied to study the surface/near-surface chemical composition of the utilized g-C3N4 film photocathodes. For the first time it is shown that g-C3N4 films can be successfully applied as photoelectrochemical material for light induced hydrogen evolution.   [1]X. Wang, K. Maeda, A. Thomas, K. Takanabe, G.

Anomalous features for hypothetical Plasma Phase Transitions (PPT), which is expected to occur in mixed hydrogen-helium plasma in interior of Jupiter and Saturn, are under discussion. The characteristics of the Coulomb and density corrections (the so-called non-ideality corrections) are reconstructed for hydrogen-helium plasma in the vicinity of phase coexistence boundary of this PPT in version of Saumon and Chabrier, using tabular data for hydrogen-helium EOS of Saumon, Chabrier and VanHorn and some general thermodynamic relations. Two previously unknown characteristics of the studied PPT have been estimated based on these results: (i) -- the jump of the electrostatic potential across the phase boundary of PPT (Galvani potential), and (ii) -- the scale of non-congruency for this PPT (the differences in chemical composition of the coexisting hydrogen-helium phases), which could be expected in H2/He mixture at typical parameters of plasma in interior of Jupiter and Saturn. While the first effect -- the potential of phase boundary -- turned out to be within the typical scale of contact electrochemical potentials, $\Delta \varphi$ ~ 1-2 eV, the second quantity -- the PPT non-congruency -- proved to be considerable under Saturn and Jupiter conditions. 
Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier and key agent for many industrial chemical processes1. One method for generating hydrogen sustainably is via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which electrochemical reduction of protons is mediated by an appropriate catalyst-traditionally, an expensive platinum-group metal. Scalable production requires catalyst alternatives that can lower materials or processing costs while retaining the highest possible activity. Strategies have included dilute alloying of Pt2 or employing less expensive transition metal alloys, compounds or heterostructures (e.g., NiMo, metal phosphides, pyrite sulfides, encapsulated metal nanoparticles)3-5. Recently, low-cost, layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (MX2)6 based on molybdenum and tungsten have attracted substantial interest as alternative HER catalysts7-11. These materials have high intrinsic per-site HER activity; however, a significant challenge is the limited density of active sites, which are concentrated at the layer edges.8,10,11. Here we use theory to unravel electronic factors underlying catalytic activity on MX2 surfaces, and leverage the understanding to report group-5 MX2 (H-TaS2 and H-NbS2) electrocatalysts whose performance instead derives from highly active basal-plane sites. Beyond excellent catalytic activity, they are found to exhibit an unusual ability to optimize their morphology for enhanced charge transfer and accessibility of active sites as the HER proceeds. This leads to long cycle life and practical advantages for scalable processing. The resulting performance is comparable to Pt and exceeds all reported MX2 candidates. 
Transition metal dichalcogenides are cheap and earth-abundant candidates for the replacement of precious metals as catalyst materials. Experimental measurements of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), for example, have demonstrated significant electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 but there is large variation depending on preparation method. In order to gain information about the mechanism and active sites for HER, we have carried out calculations of the reaction and activation energy for HER at the transition metal doped basal plane of MoS2 under electrochemical conditions, i.e. including applied electrode potential and solvent effects. The calculations are based on identifying the relevant saddle points on the energy surface obtained from density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation, and the information on energetics is used to construct voltage-dependent volcano plots. Doping with 3d-metal atoms as well as Pt is found to enhance hydrogen adsorption onto the basal plane by introducing electronic states within the band gap, and in some cases (Co, Ni, Cu, Pt) significant local symmetry breaking. The Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism is found to be most likely and the associated energetics show considerable dopant and voltage-dependence. While the binding free energy of hydrogen can be tuned to be seemingly favorable for HER, the calculated activation energy turns out to be significant, at least 0.7 eV at a voltage of -0.5 V vs. SHE, indicating low catalytic activity of the doped basal plane. This suggests that other sites are responsible for the experimental activity, possibly edges or basal plane defects. 
This paper introduces the combination of an advanced double-layer model with electrochemical kinetics to explain electrolyte effects on the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. It is known from experimental studies that the alkaline hydrogen evolution current shows a strong dependence on the concentration and identity of cations in the electrolyte, but is independent of pH. To explain these effects, we formulate the faradaic current in terms of the electric potential in the double layer, which is calculated using a mean-field model that takes into account the cation and anion sizes as well as the electric dipole moment of water molecules. We propose that the Volmer step consists of two activated processes: a water reduction sub-step, and a sub-step in which a hydroxide ion is transferred away from the reaction plane through the double layer. Either of these sub-steps may limit the rate. The proposed models for these sub-steps qualitatively explain experimental observations, including cation effects, pH-independence, and the trend reversal between gold and platinum electrodes. We also assess the quantitative accuracy of the water-reduction-limited current model; we suggest that the predicted functional relationship is valid as long as the hydrogen bonding structure of water near the electrode is sufficiently maintained. 
The extent of irreversible deactivation of Pt towards hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) due to sulfur adsorption and subsequent electrochemical oxidation is quantified in a functional PEM fuel cell. At 70 {\deg}C, sequential hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exposure and electrochemical oxidation experiments indicate that as much as 6% of total Pt sites are deactivated per monolayer sulfur adsorption at open circuit potential of a PEM fuel cell followed by its removal. The extent of such deactivation is much higher when the electrode is exposed to H2S when the fuel cell is operating at a finite load, and is dependent on the local overpotential and the duration of exposure. Regardless of this deactivation, the H2/O2 polarization curves obtained on post-recovery electrodes do not show performance losses suggesting that such performance curves alone cannot be used to assess the extent of recovery due to sulfur poisoning. A concise mechanism for the adsorption and electro-oxidation of H2S on Pt anode is presented. H2S dissociatively adsorbs onto Pt as two different sulfur species and at intermediate oxidation potentials, undergoes electro-oxidation to sulfur and then to sulfur dioxide (SO2). This mechanism is validated by charge balances between hydrogen desorption and sulfur electro-oxidation on Pt. The ignition potential for sulfur oxidation decreases with increase in temperature, which coupled with faster electro-oxidation kinetics result in the easier removal of adsorbed sulfur at higher temperatures. Furthermore, the adsorption potential is found to influence sulfur coverage of an electrode exposed to H2S. As an implication, the local potential of a PEM fuel cell anode exposed to H2S contaminated fuel should be kept below the equilibrium potential for sulfur oxidation to prevent irreversible loss of Pt sites. 
Regio-regular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (rr-P3HT), the work-horse of organic photovoltaics, has been recently exploited in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) configuration with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) for solution-processed hydrogen-evolving photocathodes, reaching cathodic photocurrents at 0 V vs. RHE (J0V vs RHE) of up to 8 mA cm-2. The photoelectrochemical performance of these photocathodes strongly depends on the presence of the electron (ESL) and hole (HSL) selective layer. While TiO2 and its sub-stoichiometric phases are consolidated ESL materials, the currently used HSLs (e.g., MoO3, CuI, PEDOTT:PSS, WO3) suffer electrochemical degradation under hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)-working conditions. In this work, we use solution-processed graphene derivatives as HSL to boost efficiency and durability of rr-P3HT:PCBM-based photocathodes, demonstrating record-high performance. In fact, our devices show cathodic J0V vs RHE of 6.01 mA cm-2, onset potential (Vo) of 0.6 V vs. RHE, ratiometric power-saved efficiency ({\phi}saved) of 1.11% and operational activity of 20 hours in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Moreover, the designed photocathodes are effectively working in different pH environments ranging from acid to basic. This is pivotal for their exploitation in tandem configurations, where photoanodes operate only in restricted electrochemical conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our all-solution processed approach by fabricating a large-area (~9 cm2) photocathode on flexible substrate, achieving remarkable cathodic J0V vs RHE of 2.8 mA cm-2, Vo of 0.45 V vs. RHE and {\phi}saved of 0.31%. This is the first demonstration of high-efficient rr-P3HT:PCBM flexible photocathodes based on low-cost and solution-processed manufacturing techniques. 
Development of cost-effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts with outstanding catalytic activity, replacing cost-prohibitive noble metal-based catalysts, is critical for practical green hydrogen production. A popular strategy for promoting the catalytic performance of noble metal-free catalysts is to incorporate earth-abundant transition metal (TM) atoms into nanocarbon platforms such as carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Although data-driven catalyst design methods can significantly accelerate the rational design of TM element-doped CQD (M@CQD) catalysts, they suffer from either a simplified theoretical model or the prohibitive cost and complexity of experimental data generation. In this study, we propose an effective and facile HER catalyst design strategy based on machine learning (ML) and ML model verification using electrochemical methods accompanied with density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Based on a Bayesian genetic algorithm (BGA) ML model, the Ni@CQD catalyst on a three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (3D rGO) conductor is proposed as the best HER catalyst under the optimal conditions of catalyst loading, electrode type, and temperature and pH of electrolyte. We validate the ML results with electrochemical experiments, where the Ni@CQD catalyst exhibited superior HER activity, requiring an overpotential of 189 mV to achieve 10 mA cm-2 with a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec-1 and impressive durability in acidic media. We expect that this methodology and the excellent performance of the Ni@CQD catalyst provide an effective route for the rational design of highly active electrocatalysts for commercial applications. 
Energy storage becomes crucial for energy systems with an increasing share of renewable energy sources. Artificial photosynthesis, in particular photovoltaic water splitting, provides both sustainable energy generation and energy storage in the form of hydrogen. However, only a few concepts for scalable devices were reported in the literature. Here, we introduce a new concept which, by design, is scalable and compatible with every thin-film photovoltaic technology. The concept allows for independent geometrical optimization of the photovoltaic and the electrochemical part. The scalability is achieved by continuous mirroring of a base unit. We demonstrate a fully integrated, wireless device with a stable and bias-free operation for 40 hours. The concept was scaled to an area of 64 cm2 comprising 13 base units and exhibited a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 3.9%. The concept and its successful realization is an important contribution towards the large scale application of artificial photosynthesis. 
Quantum proton tunneling (QPT) in the two representative multi-electron/-proton transfer electrode processes, i.e. hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), was investigated by using polycrystalline platinum (pcPt) and gold (pcAu) electrodes at 298 kelvin (K). In order to observe quantum effects in the electrode processes, the hydrogen/deuterium kinetic isotope effect constant ratio (= KH/D) was measured in a variety of conditions. In this Contribution, it is shown that the QPT in surface electrochemical system is highly affected by a choice of system. Although several systems show a clear manifestation of QPT in the electrode processes and primitive interpretations can be given to these observations, it is still challenge to derive a fine molecular-level picture on the results including several complicated effects. However, based on the observations, a selection of a full QPT path may be strongly affected by the different microscopic proton transfer mechanisms, i.e. proton transfer from hydronium ion or water molecule. 
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formation rates in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell anode and cathode were estimated as a function of humidity and temperature by studying the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE). Fuel cell conditions were replicated by depositing a film of Pt/Vulcan XC-72 catalyst onto the disk and by varying the temperature, dissolved O2 concentration and the acidity levels in hydrochloric acid (HClO4). The HClO4 acidity was correlated to ionomer water activity and hence fuel cell humidity. The H2O2 formation rates showed a linear dependence on oxygen concentration and square dependence on water activity. The H2O2 selectivity in ORR was independent of oxygen concentration but increased with decrease in water activity (i.e., decreased humidity). Potential dependent activation energy for the H2O2 formation reaction was estimated from data obtained at different temperatures. 
Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS$_2$) has been recognized as a potential substitution of Platinum (Pt) for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the broad adoption of MoS$_2$ is hindered by its limited number of active sites and relatively low inherent electrical conductivity. In this work, we demonstrated a synergistic enhancement of both active site exposure and electrical conductivity by a one-step solvothermal synthesis technique. The 1T-phase enriched MoS$_2$ was directly formed on the titanium carbide (Ti$_3$C$_2$Tx, MXene) with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) acting as crosslinks. The existence of edge-enriched metallic phase MoS$_2$, the conductive backbone of MXene along with the crosslinking function of CNTs clearly improved the overall electrical conductivity of the catalyst. Moreover, the integration of two-dimensional (2D) MoS$_2$ with MXene effectively suppressed the MXene oxidation and 2D layer restacking, leading to good catalytic stability. As a result, an overpotential of 169 mV and a low Tafel slope of 51 mV/dec was successfully achieved. This work provides a new route for 2D-based electrocatalyst engineering and sheds light on the development of the next-generation PGM-free HER electrocatalysts. 
For electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), developing high-performance catalysts without containing precious metals has been a major research focus in the current. Herein, we show the feasibility of HER catalytic enhancement in Ni-based materials based on topological engineering from hybrid Weyl states. Via a high-throughput computational screening from 140 000 materials, we identify a chiral compound NiSi is a hybrid Weyl semimetal (WSM) with showing bulk type-I and type-II Weyl nodes and long surface Fermi arcs near the Fermi level. Sufficient evidences verify that topological charge carriers participate in the HER process, and make the certain surface of NiSi highly active with the Gibbs free energy nearly zero (0.07 eV), which is even lower than Pt and locates on the top of the volcano plots. This work opens up a new routine to develop no-precious-metal-containing HER catalysts via topological engineering, rather than traditional defect engineering, doping engineering, or strain engineering. 
In this study, we demonstrate sustainable and green nanotechnology for room-temperature synthesis of H$_x$WO$_3$ ($0<x<0.5$) via a novel reaction pathway induced by mechanical energy. A simple mixture of monoclinic WO$_3$ powder and polyolefin (polypropylene) is used to obtain H$_x$WO$_3$ nanoparticles that show high crystallinity even through high-energy ball milling synthesis. The composite of H$_x$WO$_3$ nanoparticles and nanocarbon by-products exhibit unique optoelectronic properties along with outstanding enhancement of photocatalytic performance in the decomposition of azo-dye water pollutants under visible light. The formation mechanism of the obtained functional material is also discussed. The findings of this study provide insights into the limitations for mass production of H$_x$WO$_3$ nanoparticles, such as a specific setup for electrochemical reactions and precious metal catalysis. 
Fuel cells recombine water from H2 and O2 thereby powering e.g. cars or houses with no direct carbon emission. In anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), to reach high power densities, operating at high pH is an alternative to using large volumes of noble metals catalysts at the cathode, where the oxygen-reduction reaction occurs. However, the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen-oxidation reaction (HOR) hinders upscaling despite promising catalysts. Here, we observe an unexpected ingress of B into Pd nano-catalysts synthesised by wet-chemistry, gain control over this B-doping, and report on its influence on the HOR activity in alkaline conditions. We rationalize our findings using ab-initio calculations of both H- and OH-adsorption on B-doped Pd. Using this "impurity engineering" approach, we thus design Pt-free catalysts as required in electrochemical energy conversion devices, e.g. next generations of AEMFCs, that satisfy the economic and environmental constraints, i.e. reasonable operating costs and long-term stability, to enable the hydrogen economy. 
Graphene serves as an ideal platform to investigate the microscopic structure and reaction kinetics at the graphitic electrode interfaces. However, graphene is susceptible to various extrinsic factors, e.g. substrate, causing much confusion and controversy. Hereby we have obtained cm-sized substrate-free monolayer graphene suspended on electrolyte surface with gate tunability. Using sum-frequency spectroscopy, we have observed the structural evolution versus the gate voltage at the graphene/water interface. The Stern layer structure is invariant within the water electrolysis window, but undergoes drastic change when switching on the electrochemical reactions. The electrode is turned from hydrophobic to hydrophilic near the onset of hydrogen evolution reaction due to hydrogen adsorption. The large-size suspended pristine graphene offers a new platform to unravel the microscopic processes at the graphitic electrode interfaces. 
We investigated the structural evolution of electrochemically fabricated Pd nanowires $\textit{in situ}$ by means of grazing-incidence transmission small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering (GTSAXS and GTWAXS), x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and 2-dimensional surface optical reflectance (2D-SOR). This shows how electrodeposition and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compete and interact during Pd electrodepositon. During the bottom-up growth of the nanowires, we show that $\beta$-phase Pd hydride is formed. Suspending the electrodeposition then leads to a phase transition from $\beta$- to $\alpha$-phase Pd hydride. Additionally, we find that grain coalescence later hinders the incorporation of hydrogen in the Pd unit cell. GTSAXS and 2D-SOR provide complementary information on the volume fraction of the pores occupied by Pd, while XRF was used to monitor the amount of Pd electrodeposited. 
Topological states of matter and their corresponding properties are classical research topics in condensed matter physics. Quite recently, the application of materials that feature these states has been extended to the field of electrochemical catalysis and become an emerging research topic that is receiving increasing interest. In particular, several recent experimental studies performed on topological semimetals have already revealed high catalytic performance towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), strongly promoting acceptance of the fresh concept of the topological catalyst. This emerging concept has experienced rapid developments in the last few years, but these developments have been rarely summarized. Herein, we offer a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art progress in developing topological catalysts for the HER process through topological semimetals such as Weyl semimetals, Dirac semimetals, nodal line semimetals, etc. The course of development, the general research routes, and the fundamental mechanisms in topological catalysts are also systematically analyzed in this review. 
Rechargeable Zn batteries offer safe, inexpensive energy storage, but when deeply discharged to compete with lithium-ion batteries, they are plagued by parasitic reactions at the Zn anodes. We apply super-concentrated alkaline electrolytes to suppress two key parasitic reactions, hydrogen evolution and ZnO passivation. An electrolyte with 15 M KOH displays a broad electrochemical window (>2.5 V on Au), a high ZnO solubility (>1.5 M), and an exceptionally high ionic conductivity (>0.27 S/cm at 25 C). Spectroscopies and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulation suggest K+-OH- pairs and a tightened water network to underpin the stability. The simulation further reveals unique triggered proton hopping that offsets the lack of water wires to sustain the conductivity. Low hydrogen evolution, confirmed via online mass spectroscopy, and slow passivation enable a NiOOH||Zn battery to deliver a cumulative capacity of 8.4 Ah cm-2 and a Zn-air battery to last for over 110 hours. 
Hydrogen is a promising alternative energy carrier that can potentially facilitate the transition from fossil fuels to sources of clean energy because of its prominent advantages such as high energy density (142 MJ per kg), great variety of potential sources (for example water, biomass, organic matter), and low environmental impact (water is the sole combustion product). However, due to its light weight, the efficient storage of hydrogen is still an issue investigated intensely. Various solid media have been considered in that respect among which magnesium hydride stands out as a candidate offering distinct advantages. Recent theoretical work indicates that MgH2 becomes less thermodynamically stable as particle diameter decreases below 2 nm. Our DFT (density functional theory) modeling studies have shown that the smallest enthalpy change, corresponding to 2 unit-cell thickness (1.6 {\AA} Mg/3.0{\AA} MgH2) of the film, is 57.7 kJ/molMg. This enthalpy change is over 10 kJ per molMg smaller than that of the bulk. It is important to note that the range of enthalpy change for systems that are suitable for mobile storage applications is 15 to 24 kJ permolH at 298 K. The important key for the development of air/stable Mg/nanocrystals is the use of PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) as an encapsulation agent. In our work we use laser ablation, a non-electrochemical method, for producing well dispersed nanoparticles without the presence of any long range aggregation. The observed improved hydrogenation characteristics of the polymer/stable Mg-nanoparticles are associated to the preparation procedure and in any case the polymer laser ablation is a new approach for the production of air/protected and inexpensive Mg/nanoparticles. 
Electrocatalysis is a catalytic process where the rate of an electrochemical reaction occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface can be controlled by varying the electrical potential. Electrocatalysis can be applied to generate hydrogen which can be stored for future use in fuel cells for clean electricity. The use of solid oxide in electrocatalysis specially in hydrogen evolution reaction is promising. However, further improvements are essential in order to meet the ever-increasing global energy demand. Improvement of the performance of these high energy chemical systems is directly linked to the understanding and improving the complex physical and chemical phenomena and exchanges that take place at their different interfaces. To enable large length and time scale atomistic simulations of solid oxide electrocatalysis for hydrogen generation, we developed an eReaxFF force field for barium zirconate doped with 20 mol% of yttrium (BZY20). All parameters for the eReaxFF were optimized to reproduce quantum mechanical (QM) calculations on relevant condensed phase and cluster systems describing oxygen vacancies, vacancy migrations, water adsorption, water splitting and hydrogen generation on the surfaces of the BZY20 solid oxide. Using the developed force field, we performed zero-voltage molecular dynamics simulations to observe water adsorption and the eventual hydrogen production. Based on our simulation results, we conclude that this force field sets a stage for the introduction of explicit electron concept in order to simulate electron conductivity, electron leakage and non-zero-voltage effects on hydrogen generation. Overall, we demonstrate how atomistic-scale simulations can enhance our understanding of processes at interfaces in solid oxide materials. 
The technique presented here for the measurement of electrical conductivity is based on the principle that the current converges on a small disk electrode. Most of the ohmic resistance therefore lies within a narrow region surrounding the disk. If the reference electrode is kept outside this zone, the potential difference between the working and the reference electrode includes practically all ohmic potential drops occurring in the solution. Moreover, this ohmic drop can be related to the conductivity of the solution by an analytical expression derived by Newman. At sufficiently high overpotentials, the rate of charge transfer is limited by the conduction of current from the bulk solution to the electrode. In this regime, the current varies linearly with the electrode potential and the conductivity of the solution can be estimated from the slope of the voltammogram using Newman's expression. The electrochemical reaction used for measuring conductivity of solutions of salts is the cathodic reduction of water and that used for aqueous acids is the cathodic reduction of hydrogen ions. The technique has been used to measure conductivity of several common aqueous electrolytes. A good agreement is found between the present technique and the conventional technique based on AC impedance analysis. 
The size of the band gap and the energy position of the band edges make several oxynitride semiconductors promising candidates for efficient hydrogen and oxygen production under solar light illumination. The intense research efforts dedicated to oxynitride materials have unveiled the majority of their most important properties. However, two crucial aspects have received much less attention. One is the critical issue of the compositional/structural surface modifications occurring during operation and how these affect the photoelectrochemical performance. The second concerns the relation between the electrochemical response and the crystallographic surface orientation of the oxynitride semiconductor. These are indeed topics of fundamental importance since it is exactly at the surface where the visible light-driven electrochemical reaction takes place. In contrast to conventional powder samples, thin films represent the best model system for these investigations. This study reviews current state-of-the-art of oxynitride thin film fabrication and characterization before focusing on LaTiO2N selected as representative photocatalyst. We report the investigation of the initial physicochemical evolution of the surface. Then we show that, after stabilization, the absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency of epitaxial thin films can differ by about 50% for different crystallographic surface orientations and be up to 5 times larger than for polycrystalline samples. 
Aqueous rechargeable batteries are promising energy storage devices for the high safety, environmental friendliness, and easy assembly. However, their cycle stability and low temperature performance are limited by the narrow electrochemical stability window and the high freezing point of the aqueous electrolytes. Here, a hybrid electrolyte with a wide electrochemical window (2.15V) and a low freezing point (-60 oC) is developed by using EMIMDep as a novel additive. The hydrophobic EMIM+ accumulates on the negatively charged electrode and repels the water molecules, thus suppressing the water splitting. Meanwhile, the hydrophilic Dep- forms strong hydrogen bonds with water, thereby reducing the freezing point of the electrolyte. In addition, the hybrid 1 M LiNO3 in EMIMDep20-H2O80 electrolytes exhibit high safety and high stability due to the non-flammability, non-volatility, and low toxicity of the EMIMDep compared with other organic additives. Owing to the advantages of the aqueous/EMIMDep electrolyte, the full battery with LiTi$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ anode and LiMn$_2$O$_4$ cathode delivers an average voltage of 1.6 V and a specific capacity of 120 mAh/g with a capacity retention of 80% after 500 cycles at 1C. In addition, the full battery working at -35 oC delivers 60% specific capacity of that at room temperature. 
Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) based on insertion electrodes reach intrinsic capacity limits. Performance improvements and cost reduction require alternative reaction mechanisms and novel battery chemistries such as conversion reactions and sodium-ion batteries (NaBs), respectively. We here study the formation of Ti1-xVxH2 hydrides (0 < x < 1) and their electrochemical properties as anodes in LiBs and NaBs half-cells. Hydrides were synthesized by mechanochemistry of the metal powders under hydrogen atmosphere (PH2~ 8 MPa). For V contents below 80 at.% (x < 0.8), single-phase pseudobinary dihydride compounds Ti1-xVxH2 are formed. They crystallize in the fluorite-type structure and are highly nanostructured (crystallite size < 10 nm). Their lattice parameter decreases linearly with the V content leading to hydride destabilization. Electrochemical studies were first carried out in Li-ion half cells with full conversion between Ti1-xVxH2 hydrides and lithium. The potential of the conversion reaction can be gradually tuned with the vanadium content due to its destabilization effect. Furthermore, different paths for the conversion reaction are observed for Ti-rich (x < 0.25) and V-rich (x > 0.7) alloys. Na-ion half-cell measurements prove the reactivity between (V,Ti)H2 hydrides and sodium, albeit with significant kinetic limitations 
This article reviews the current state of teaching and learning mathematical modeling in the context of sustainable development goals for education at the tertiary level. While ample research on mathematical modeling education and published textbooks on the topic are available, there is a lack of focus on mathematical modeling for sustainability. This review aims to address this gap by exploring the powerful intersection of mathematical modeling and sustainability. Mathematical modeling for sustainability connects two distinct realms: learning about the mathematics of sustainability and promoting sustainable learning in mathematics education. The former involves teaching and learning sustainability quantitatively, while the latter encompasses pedagogy that enables learners to apply quantitative knowledge and skills to everyday life and continue learning and improving mathematically beyond formal education. To demonstrate the practical application of mathematical modeling for sustainability, we discuss a specific textbook suitable for a pilot liberal arts course. We illustrate how learners can grasp mathematical concepts related to sustainability through simple yet mathematically diverse examples, which can be further developed for teaching such a course. Indeed, by filling the gap in the literature and providing practical resources, this review contributes to the advancement of mathematical modeling education in the context of sustainability. 
Sustainable business models also offer banks competitive advantages such as increasing brand reputation and cost reduction. However, no framework is presented to evaluate the sustainability of banking business models. To bridge this theoretical gap, the current study using A Delphi-Analytic Hierarchy Process method, firstly, developed a sustainable business model to evaluate the sustainability of the business model of banks. In the second step, the sustainability performance of sixteen banks from eight European countries including Norway, the UK, Poland, Hungary, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy, assessed. The proposed business model components of this study were ranked in terms of their impact on achieving sustainability goals. Consequently, the proposed model components of this study, based on their impact on sustainability, are respectively value proposition, core competencies, financial aspects, business processes, target customers, resources, technology, customer interface, and partner network. The results of the comparison of the banks studied by each country disclosed that the sustainability of the Norwegian and German banks business models is higher than in other counties. The studied banks of Hungary and Spain came in second, the banks of the UK, Poland, and France ranked third, and finally, the Italian banks ranked fourth in the sustainability of their business models. 
The need for efficient and sustainable software to improve business and achieve goals cannot be over-emphasized. Sustainable digital services and product delivery cannot be achieved without embracing sustainable software design practices. Despite the current research progress on software sustainability, most software development practitioners in developing countries are unclear about what constitutes software sustainability and often lack the proper understanding of how to implement it in their specific industry domain. Research efforts from software engineering focused on promoting software sustainability awareness in developed countries, and fewer efforts have been channeled to studying the same awareness in developing countries. This has affected the level of awareness about sustainable software design practices in most developing countries. This research investigates the awareness of software sustainability in the Nigerian pension industry and its challenges among practitioners. The software development practitioners were engaged and interviewed. We offered ways to mitigate the identified challenges and promote the awareness of software sustainability in the pension industry. Our findings further show that, with the right sustainability knowledge, the software practitioners in the pension industry have the potential to support their organization's sustainable culture and improve the efficiency of product design and service delivery. 
Parallel to the rising debates over sustainable energy and artificial intelligence solutions, the world is currently discussing the ethics of artificial intelligence and its possible negative effects on society and the environment. In these arguments, sustainable AI is proposed, which aims at advancing the pathway toward sustainability, such as sustainable energy. In this paper, we offered a novel contextual topic modeling combining LDA, BERT, and Clustering. We then combined these computational analyses with content analysis of related scientific publications to identify the main scholarly topics, sub-themes, and cross-topic themes within scientific research on sustainable AI in energy. Our research identified eight dominant topics including sustainable buildings, AI-based DSSs for urban water management, climate artificial intelligence, Agriculture 4, the convergence of AI with IoT, AI-based evaluation of renewable technologies, smart campus and engineering education, and AI-based optimization. We then recommended 14 potential future research strands based on the observed theoretical gaps. Theoretically, this analysis contributes to the existing literature on sustainable AI and sustainable energy, and practically, it intends to act as a general guide for energy engineers and scientists, AI scientists, and social scientists to widen their knowledge of sustainability in AI and energy convergence research. 
The advancement of software sustainability encounters notable challenges, underscoring the necessity for understanding these challenges to facilitate significant progress and pave the way for effective solutions to advance software sustainability. This paper outlines key challenges identified in literature based on findings from a tertiary study. Challenges identified include: confusion regarding the definition of software sustainability, uncertainty about when to consider sustainability in software development, lack of assessment metrics and tools, narrow perspectives on sustainability in software systems, insufficient awareness and education, and a lack of serious considerations in practice. The paper aims at clarifying the confusion surrounding software sustainability to motivate effective solutions. The provided recommendations aim to give a more organized approach towards advancing sustainable software development, emphasizing comprehensive strategies, the integration of sustainability as a fundamental aspect of software development, actionable research directions, and the cultivation of a common understanding of sustainable software. 
Sustainable procurement requires organizations to align their purchasing behavior with regard to broader goals linked to resource efficiency, climate change, social responsibility and other sustainability criteria. The level of sustainability in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) hardware procurement is analyzed for two reasons: First, ICT hardware belongs to the six key product groups in sustainable procurement. Second, ICT in general is expected to be an important enabler for low-carbon economies, providing solutions to reduce Green-House Gas (GHG) emissions. While the advantages of sustainable procurement are obvious, certain barriers hinder the adoption in day-to-day procurement. This case study on ICT hardware discusses the three important barriers "lack of clear definitions per product group", "missing market intelligence about sustainable products" and "inflexible procedures and attitudes as barriers for innovative approaches" based on an in-depth analysis of sustainable procurement of ICT hardware by the public sector in Switzerland. To this end, tender data published on the national procurement platform simap.ch is screened for sustainability criteria using the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) nomenclature to identify relevant ICT projects. The results reveal to which extent such criteria as well as their determinants are currently included in public tenders. Using two different approaches, only a small number of tenders were found containing sustainability criteria of a wide range from basic to comprehensive. The overall performance of Swiss public procurement is benchmarked by comparing the identified sustainability criteria with available criteria from international key actors in sustainable procurement. Thus, this analysis provides novel insights on how public agencies today take sustainability into account when procuring ICT hardware. 
The importance of promoting sustainable and environmentally responsible practices is becoming increasingly recognized in all domains, including tourism. The impact of tourism extends beyond its immediate stakeholders and affects passive participants such as the environment, local businesses, and residents. City trips, in particular, offer significant opportunities to encourage sustainable tourism practices by directing travelers towards destinations that minimize environmental impact while providing enriching experiences. Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS) can play a critical role in this. By integrating sustainability features in TRS, travelers can be guided towards destinations that meet their preferences and align with sustainability objectives.   This paper investigates how different user interface design elements affect the promotion of sustainable city trip choices. We explore the impact of various features on user decisions, including sustainability labels for transportation modes and their emissions, popularity indicators for destinations, seasonality labels reflecting crowd levels for specific months, and an overall sustainability composite score. Through a user study involving mockups, participants evaluated the helpfulness of these features in guiding them toward more sustainable travel options.   Our findings indicate that sustainability labels significantly influence users towards lower-carbon footprint options, while popularity and seasonality indicators guide users to less crowded and more seasonally appropriate destinations. This study emphasizes the importance of providing users with clear and informative sustainability information, which can help them make more sustainable travel choices. It lays the groundwork for future applications that can recommend sustainable destinations in real-time. 
In order to succeed, universities are forced to respond to the new challenges in the rapidly changing world. The recently emerging fourth-generation universities should meet sustainability objectives to better serve their students and their communities. It is essential for universities to measure their sustainability performance to capitalise on their core strengths and to overcome their weaknesses. In line with the stakeholder theory, the objective of this study was to investigate students perceptions of university sustainability including their expectations about and satisfaction with the efforts that universities make towards sustainability. This paper proposes a new approach that combines the sustainable university scale, developed by the authors, with the importance-performance analysis to identify key areas of university sustainability. To collect data, an online survey was conducted in Hungary in 2019. The sustainable university scale was found to be a reliable construct to measure different aspects of university sustainability. Results of the importance-performance analysis suggest that students consider Hungarian universities unsustainable. Research findings indicate that Hungarian universities perform poorly in sustainable purchasing and renewable energy use, but their location and their efforts towards separate waste collection are their major competitive advantages. The main domains of university sustainability were also discussed. This study provides university decision-makers and researchers with insightful results supporting the transformation of traditional universities into sustainable, fourth-generation higher education institutions. 
Recently, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) has become an important factor in companies' sustainable development. Artificial intelligence (AI) is also a core digital technology that can create innovative, sustainable, comprehensive, and resilient environments. ESG- and AI-based digital transformation is a relevant strategy for managing business value and sustainability in corporate green management operations. Therefore, this study examines how corporate sustainability relates to ESG- and AI-based digital transformation. Furthermore, it confirms the moderating effect of green innovation on the process of increasing sustainability. To achieve the purpose of this study, 359 data points collected for hypothesis testing were used for statistical analysis and for mobile business platform users. The following conclusions are drawn. (1) ESG activities have become key variables that enable sustainable corporate growth. Companies can implement eco-friendly operating processes through ESG activities. (2) This study verifies the relationship between AI-based digital transformation and corporate sustainability and confirms that digital transformation positively affects corporate sustainability. In addition, societal problems can be identified and environmental accidents prevented through technological innovation. (3) This study does not verify the positive moderating effect of green innovation; however, it emphasizes its necessity and importance. Although green innovation improves performance only in the long term, it is a key factor for companies pursuing sustainable growth. This study reveals that ESG- and AI-based digital transformation is an important tool for promoting corporate sustainability, broadening the literature in related fields and providing insights for corporate management and government policymakers to advance corporate sustainability. 
The aim of the research paper is to understand the sustainability challenges faced by resorts mainly luxury in Maldives and to implement the sustainable tourism practices. The Maldives economy is dependent mostly on the fishing, boat building, boat repairing and tourism. Over recent years there is a drastic change that has took place in Maldives in tourism industry. Maldives has progressed to be the upper middle-income country and luxury resorts are the reason for increased GDP in the country. Although there are some practices associated with the luxury resorts to follow in terms of environmental concerns. Present study focuses on the triple bottom line approach and the 12 major Sustainable Tourism Principles as a framework for sustainability practices and its implementation including the challenges associated in Maldives. The paper suggests some recommendations on several paradigm of enforcing laws and regulations, waste management facilities, fostering collaboration along with promoting local agriculture. The study also contemplates on several other areas such as on the impact of sustainability initiatives, coral restoration, and the use of sustainable supply chains. The intent of the current research is to suggest methods to promote the sustainable practices in luxury resort in Maldives. 
This systematic literature review explores sustainability assessment frameworks (SAFs) across diverse industries. The review focuses on SAF design approaches including the methods used for Sustainability Indicator (SI) selection, relative importance assessment, and interdependency analysis. Various methods, including literature reviews, stakeholder interviews, questionnaires, Pareto analysis, SMART approach, and adherence to sustainability standards, contribute to the complex SI selection process. Fuzzy-AHP stands out as a robust technique for assessing relative SI importance. While dynamic sustainability and performance indices are essential, methods like DEMATEL, VIKOR, correlation analysis, and causal models for interdependency assessment exhibit static limitations. The review presents strengths and limitations of SAFs, addressing gaps in design approaches and contributing to a comprehensive understanding. The insights of this review aim to benefit policymakers, administrators, leaders, and researchers, fostering sustainability practices. Future research recommendations include exploring multi-criteria decision-making models and hybrid approaches, extending sustainability evaluation across organizational levels and supply chains. Emphasizing adaptability to industry specifics and dynamic global adjustments is proposed for holistic sustainability practices, further enhancing organizational sustainability. 
Sustainability in accounting and controlling has traditionally been understood in terms of securing the long-term existence of companies. However, with the introduction of integrated non-financial reporting, sustainability, as per the triple bottom line model, is increasingly being discussed as a component of accounting and controlling. Yet, integration primarily occurs in separate sustainability management and controlling departments. Moreover, the implementation of sustainability efforts requires suitably qualified employees, who drive the transition. The academic discourse surrounding sustainability in businesses in general, and in accounting and controlling specifically, is complex. It remains unclear to what extent sustainability has been integrated into accounting and controlling, and what competencies employees need to manage this transformation. These questions will be critically analyzed in this structured literature review of 79 publications. The results provide insights into a) how companies conceptualize sustainability, b) whether and how they integrate it into their value creation processes, and c) the relevance of accounting and controlling for these developments. To contextualize the role of employees, the competency requirements within companies will be analyzed to enable employees in accounting and controlling to engage effectively in sustainability-oriented activities. Specifically, implications for changes in curricula with a focus on accounting and controlling are derived. 
Achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demands adequate levels of awareness and actions to address sustainability challenges. Software systems will play an important role in moving towards these targets. Sustainability skills are necessary to support the development of software systems and to provide sustainable IT-supported services for citizens. While there is a growing number of academic bodies, including sustainability education in engineering and computer science curricula, there is not yet comprehensive research on the competencies and skills required by IT professionals to develop such systems. This study aims to identify the industrial sustainability needs for education and training from software engineers' perspective. We conducted interviews and focus groups with experts from twenty-eight organisations with an IT division from nine countries to understand their interests, goals and achievements related to sustainability, and the skills and competencies needed to achieve their goals. Our findings show that organisations are interested in sustainability, both idealistically and increasingly for core business reasons. They seek to improve the sustainability of processes and products but encounter difficulties, like the trade-off between short-term financial profitability and long-term sustainability goals. To fill the gaps, they have promoted in-house training courses, collaborated with universities, and sent employees to external training. The acquired competencies make sustainability an integral part of software development. We conclude that educational programs should include knowledge and skills on core sustainability concepts, system thinking, soft skills, technical sustainability, sustainability impact and measurements, values and ethics, standards and legal aspects, and advocacy and lobbying. 
Sustainability is focussed on avoiding the long-term depletion of natural resources. Under the terms of a government plan to tackle climate change, a driver for improved sustainability is the cut of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK to almost zero by 2050. With this type of change, new themes are continuously being developed which drive complex projects, such as the development of new power generation methods, which encompass challenging lead times and demanding requirements. Consideration of the implementation of strategies and key concepts, which may engender sustainability within complex projects therefore presents an opportunity for further critical debate, review, and application through a project management lens. Sustainability incorporation in project management has been documented in academic literature, with this emerging field providing new challenges. For example, project management education can provide a holistic base for the inculcation of sustainability factors to a range of industries, including complex projects. Likewise, practitioner interest and approaches to sustainability in project management are being driven by the recently Chartered Association for Project Management (APM). Whilst this body makes a significant contribution to the UK economy across many sectors, it also addresses ongoing sustainability challenges. Therefore, by drawing on research and practitioner developments, the authors argue that by connecting with the next generation through practice simulation approaches, and embedding sustainability issues within project management tools and methods, improved focus on sustainability in complex project management may be achieved. 
The recent studies signify the growing concern of researchers towards monitoring and measuring sustainability performance at various levels and in many fields, including healthcare. However, there is no agreed approach to assessing the sustainability of health systems. Moreover, social indicators are less developed and less succinct. Therefore, the authors seek to map sustainable reference values in healthcare and propose a conceptual and structured framework that can guide the measurement of the social sustainability-oriented health systems. Based on a new multi-criteria method called Strong Sustainability Paradigm based Analytical Hierarchy Process, (SSP-AHP), the presented approach opens the availability for systems' comparison and benchmarking. The Strong Sustainability Paradigm incorporated into the multi-criteria evaluation method prevents the exchangeability of criteria by promoting alternatives that achieve good performance values on all criteria, implying sustainability. The research results offer insights into the core domains, sub-domains, and indicators supporting a more comprehensive assessment of the social sustainability of health systems. The framework constructed in this study consists of five major areas: equity, quality, responsiveness, financial coverage, and adaptability. The proposed set of indicators can also serve as a reference instrument, providing transparency about core aspects of performance to be measured and reported, as well as supporting policy-makers in decisions regarding sectoral strategies in healthcare. Our findings suggest that the most socially sustainable systems are Nordic countries. They offer a high level of social and financial protection, achieving very good health outcomes. On the other hand, the most unsustainable systems located in central and eastern European countries. 
Technology solutions must effectively balance economic growth, social equity, and environmental integrity to achieve a sustainable society. Notably, although the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm constitutes a key sustainability enabler, critical issues such as the increasing maintenance operations, energy consumption, and manufacturing/disposal of IoT devices have long-term negative economic, societal, and environmental impacts and must be efficiently addressed. This calls for self-sustainable IoT ecosystems requiring minimal external resources and intervention, effectively utilizing renewable energy sources, and recycling materials whenever possible, thus encompassing energy sustainability. In this work, we focus on energy-sustainable IoT during the operation phase, although our discussions sometimes extend to other sustainability aspects and IoT lifecycle phases. Specifically, we provide a fresh look at energy-sustainable IoT and identify energy provision, transfer, and energy efficiency as the three main energy-related processes whose harmonious coexistence pushes toward realizing self-sustainable IoT systems. Their main related technologies, recent advances, challenges, and research directions are also discussed. Moreover, we overview relevant performance metrics to assess the energy-sustainability potential of a certain technique, technology, device, or network and list some target values for the next generation of wireless systems. Overall, this paper offers insights that are valuable for advancing sustainability goals for present and future generations. 
Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities have increased the eagerness of companies to integrate AI into software systems. While AI can be used to have a positive impact on several dimensions of sustainability, this is often overshadowed by its potential negative influence. While many studies have explored sustainability factors in isolation, there is insufficient holistic coverage of potential sustainability benefits or costs that practitioners need to consider during decision-making for AI adoption. We therefore aim to synthesize trade-offs related to sustainability in the context of integrating AI into software systems. We want to make the sustainability benefits and costs of integrating AI more transparent and accessible for practitioners.   The study was conducted in collaboration with a Dutch financial organization. We first performed a rapid review that led to the inclusion of 151 research papers. Afterward, we conducted six semi-structured interviews to enrich the data with industry perspectives. The combined results showcase the potential sustainability benefits and costs of integrating AI. The labels synthesized from the review regarding potential sustainability benefits were clustered into 16 themes, with "energy management" being the most frequently mentioned one. 11 themes were identified in the interviews, with the top mentioned theme being "employee wellbeing". Regarding sustainability costs, the review discovered seven themes, with "deployment issues" being the most popular one, followed by "ethics & society". "Environmental issues" was the top theme from the interviews. Our results provide valuable insights to organizations and practitioners for understanding the potential sustainability implications of adopting AI. 
Pursuing sustainable development has become a global imperative, underscored adopting of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). At the heart of this agenda lies the recognition of social sustainability as a pivotal component, emphasizing the need for inclusive societies where every individual can thrive. Despite its significance, social sustainability remains a "forgotten pillar," often overshadowed by environmental concerns. In response, this paper presents the development and validation of the S-Assessment Tool for Social Sustainability, a comprehensive questionnaire designed to evaluate organizations' performance across critical dimensions such as health and wellness, gender equality, decent work, and economic growth, reducing inequalities, and responsible production and consumption. The questionnaire was constructed on the critical dimensions identified through a systematic and narrative hybrid approach to the analysis of peer-reviewed literature. The framework has been structured around the values of the SDGs. It aims to empower organizations to better understand and address their social impact, fostering positive change and contributing to the collective effort towards a more equitable and sustainable future. Through collaborative partnerships and rigorous methodology, this research underscores the importance of integrating social sustainability into organizational practices and decision-making processes, ultimately advancing the broader agenda of sustainable development. 
The assessment of corporate sustainability performance is extremely relevant in facilitating the transition to a green and low-carbon intensity economy. However, companies located in different areas may be subject to different sustainability and environmental risks and policies. Henceforth, the main objective of this paper is to investigate the spatial and temporal pattern of the sustainability evaluations of European firms. We leverage on a large dataset containing information about companies' sustainability performances, measured by MSCI ESG ratings, and geographical coordinates of firms in Western Europe between 2013 and 2023. By means of a modified version of the Chavent et al. (2018) hierarchical algorithm, we conduct a spatial clustering analysis, combining sustainability and spatial information, and a spatiotemporal clustering analysis, which combines the time dynamics of multiple sustainability features and spatial dissimilarities, to detect groups of firms with homogeneous sustainability performance. We are able to build cross-national and cross-industry clusters with remarkable differences in terms of sustainability scores. Among other results, in the spatio-temporal analysis, we observe a high degree of geographical overlap among clusters, indicating that the temporal dynamics in sustainability assessment are relevant within a multidimensional approach. Our findings help to capture the diversity of ESG ratings across Western Europe and may assist practitioners and policymakers in evaluating companies facing different sustainability-linked risks in different areas. 
Rough surfaces submerged in a liquid can remain almost dry if the liquid does not fully wet the roughness and gases are sustained in roughness grooves. Such partially dry surfaces can help reduce drag or enhance boiling. Gases sustained in roughness grooves would be composed of air and the vapor phase of the liquid itself. The thermodynamics of sustaining vapor was considered in a prior work [Patankar, Soft Matter, 2010, 6:1613]. Here, the thermodynamics of sustaining gases (e.g. air) is considered. Governing equations are presented along with a solution methodology to determine a critical condition to sustain gases. The critical roughness scale to sustain gases is estimated for different degrees of saturation of gases dissolved in the liquid. It is shown that roughness spacings of less than a micron are essential to sustain gases on surfaces submerged in water at atmospheric pressure. This is consistent with prior empirical data. 
The concern about sustainability has arisen due to the overuse of natural resources and the increased use of energy consumption over the last decades. Information communication technologies (ICT) has the potential to address the three main aspects of sustainability (people, planet, profit) and therefore, several organizations have initiated a sustainable development by integrating ICT within their business activities. However, the roles of ICT in supporting sustainability initiatives have only been discussed in a limited number of studies and there is a lack of practical examples that demonstrate how the different roles of ICT are played out in an organization's environment. Therefore, this research aims to explore how ICT can be used by organizations to support sustainability initiatives. In particular, in this research-in-progress paper, we examine how a leading organization deploys Internet-of-Things as an example of an ICT application to support various sustainability initiatives. The study findings enhance the current understanding of how ICT can support sustainability practices of organizations. 
Sustainability and resilience of urban systems are multifaceted concepts, requiring information about multiple system attributes to adequately evaluate and characterize. However, despite the scientific consensus on the multivariate nature of these concepts, many of the existing techniques to model urban sustainability and resilience are unidimensional in nature, focusing on a characterizing a single element of highly interconnected urban systems. We champion a paradigm shift in modeling urban sustainability and resilience, using an integrated approach to simultaneously estimate multiple interconnected (correlated) system attributes of sustainability and resilience as a function of key environmental factors. We present a novel case study and review a few recent studies to illustrate the applicability and benefits of the multivariate approach to modeling urban sustainability and resilience. Our proposed framework can be utilized by infrastructure managers, urban planners, and researchers to conceptualize and assess urban sustainability and resilience more holistically, and to better understand the key factors in advancing the sustainability and resilience of infrastructure systems. 
Plant biomass estimation is critical due to the variability of different environmental factors and crop management practices associated with it. The assessment is largely impacted by the accurate prediction of different environmental sustainability indicators. A robust model to predict sustainability indicators is a must for the biomass community. This study proposes a robust model for biomass sustainability prediction by analyzing sustainability indicators using machine learning models. The prospect of ensemble learning was also investigated to analyze the regression problem. All experiments were carried out on a crop residue data from the Ohio state. Ten machine learning models, namely, linear regression, ridge regression, multilayer perceptron, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, decision tree, gradient boosting, random forest, stacking and voting, were analyzed to estimate three biomass sustainability indicators, namely soil erosion factor, soil conditioning index, and organic matter factor. The performance of the model was assessed using cross-correlation (R2), root mean squared error and mean absolute error metrics. The results showed that Random Forest was the best performing model to assess sustainability indicators. The analyzed model can now serve as a guide for assessing sustainability indicators in real time. 
In software industry, the DevOps is an increasingly adopting software development paradigm. Towards the sustainable DevOps adoption, there is a need to transform the organization Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing (CAMS) aspects concerning to core theme of continues development and operations. The software organizations face several complexities while implementing the DevOps principles. The sustainable DevOps implementation assist the software organizations to develop the quality projects with good return on investment. This evidence-based study aims to explore the guidelines of sustainable DevOps implementation, reported in literature and industry practices. Using systematic literature review and questionnaire survey, we identified the 48 guidelines for sustainable DevOps implementation. We further develop a decision-making framework aiming to assist the practitioners to consider the most significant set of guidelines on priority. The results show that out of CAMS, culture is the most important principle for sustainable DevOps implementation. Moreover, (i) enterprises should focus on building a collaborative culture with shared goals, (ii) assess your organization readiness to utilize a microservices architecture and (iii) educate executives at your company about the benefits of DevOps to gain resource and budget support are the highest priority guidelines for sustainable DevOps implementation. We believe that this in-depth study helps the practitioners to understand the core principles and guidelines for sustainable DevOps implementation. 
The increased use of AI systems is associated with multi-faceted societal, environmental, and economic consequences. These include non-transparent decision-making processes, discrimination, increasing inequalities, rising energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in AI model development and application, and an increasing concentration of economic power. By considering the multi-dimensionality of sustainability, this paper takes steps towards substantiating the call for an overarching perspective on "sustainable AI". It presents the SCAIS Framework (Sustainability Criteria and Indicators for Artificial Intelligence Systems) which contains a set 19 sustainability criteria for sustainable AI and 67 indicators that is based on the results of a critical review and expert workshops. This interdisciplinary approach contributes a unique holistic perspective to facilitate and structure the discourse on sustainable AI. Further, it provides a concrete framework that lays the foundation for developing standards and tools to support the conscious development and application of AI systems. 
This paper examines how investment in environmentally sustainable practices impacts employment and labor productivity growth of firms in transition economies. The study considers labor skill composition and geographical differences, shedding light on sustainability dynamics. The empirical analysis relies on the World Bank-s Enterprise Survey 2019 for 24 transition economies, constructing an environmental sustainability index from various indicators through a Principal Components Analysis. To address endogeneity, a battery of fixed effects and instrumental variables are employed. Results reveal the relevance of environmental sustainability for both employment and labor productivity growth. However, the significance diminishes when addressing endogeneity comprehensively, alluding that any relation between environmentally sustainable practices and jobs growth is more complex and needs time to work. The decelerating job-creation effect of sustainability investments is however confirmed for the high-skill firms, while low-skill firms benefit from labor productivity gains spurred by such investment. Geographically, Central Europe sees more pronounced labor productivity impacts, possibly due to its higher development and sustainability-awareness levels as compared to Southeast Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
In response to aggressive scaling demands in semiconductor manufacturing and the growing need to apply sustainable practices, this paper presents a holistic sustainability assessment framework for evaluating alternative metals for advanced applications. The framework, consisting of seven sustainability aspects, aims to guide researchers and industry stakeholders towards decisions fostering a more sustainable and secure future for microelectronics. This study applies the framework to assess the sustainability of alternative local interconnect metals. The framework identifies five metals (Ti, Al, Ni, Co, and Mo) with relatively favourable performance in at least six out of nine specific indicators, while others (Pt, Ru, Ir, Rh, and Pd) exhibit poorer sustainability metrics. The study recommends further analyses, suggesting the incorporation of case-specific functional units and the use of normalization and weighting factors for a comprehensive evaluation. Coupled with traditional technological assessments, this framework equips decision-makers with essential tools to broaden criteria for selecting alternative metals, aligning semiconductor manufacturing with broader sustainability objectives. 
Data physicalizations have gained prominence across domains, but their environmental impact has been largely overlooked. This work addresses this gap by investigating the interplay between sustainability and physicalization practices. We conducted interviews with experts from diverse backgrounds, followed by a survey to gather insights into how they approach physicalization projects and reflect on sustainability. Our thematic analysis revealed sustainability considerations throughout the entire physicalization life cycle -- a framework that encompasses various stages in a physicalization's existence. Notably, we found no single agreed-upon definition for sustainable physicalizations, highlighting the complexity of integrating sustainability into physicalization practices. We outline sustainability challenges and strategies based on participants' experiences and propose the Sustainable Physicalization Practices (SuPPra) Matrix, providing a structured approach for designers to reflect on and enhance the environmental impact of their future physicalizations. 
Modern data centers suffer from a growing carbon footprint due to insufficient support for environmental sustainability. While hardware accelerators and renewable energy have been utilized to enhance sustainability, addressing Quality of Service (QoS) degradation caused by renewable energy supply and hardware recycling remains challenging: (1) prior accelerators exhibit significant carbon footprints due to limited reconfigurability and inability to adapt to renewable energy fluctuations; (2) integrating recycled NAND flash chips in data centers poses challenges due to their short lifetime, increasing energy consumption; (3) the absence of a sustainability estimator impedes data centers and users in evaluating and improving their environmental impact. This study aims to improve system support for environmentally sustainable data centers by proposing a reconfigurable hardware accelerator for intensive computing primitives and developing a fractional NAND flash cell to extend the lifetime of recycled flash chips while supporting graceful capacity degradation. We also introduce a sustainability estimator to evaluate user task energy consumption and promote sustainable practices. We present our preliminary results and recognize this as an ongoing initiative with significant potential to advance environmentally sustainable computing in data centers and stimulate further exploration in this critical research domain. 
Sustainable road freight transport becomes indispensable in the field of transportation and logistics. The new technological change, the environmental impacts, and social responsibility laid freight road transport in front of various challenges, which makes the sustainable practices a vital solution in the sector. This paper aims to provide a theoretical research findings in sustainable road freight transport. The methodology discusses the road freight transport sustainability indicators among the literature studies realized in different countries in the world. The review analysis the studies and practical applications from various countries. The result exposes that the sustainability dimensions such as economic, social, environment was discussed in different cases, which prove the efforts of many countries to reduce environmental impact, improve economic efficiency, support social well-being, and expand technological innovations to achieve a sustainable transport system. 
An important result from psycholinguistics (Griffiths & Kalish, 2005) states that no language can be learned iteratively by rational agents in a self-sustaining manner. We show how to modify the learning process slightly in order to achieve self-sustainability. Our work is in two parts. First, we characterize iterated learnability in geometric terms and show how a slight, steady increase in the lengths of the training sessions ensures self-sustainability for any discrete language class. In the second part, we tackle the nondiscrete case and investigate self-sustainability for iterated linear regression. We discuss the implications of our findings to issues of non-equilibrium dynamics in natural algorithms. 
We developed a pilot course focused on mathematical modeling within the tertiary education framework, with a distinct emphasis on sustainability and sustainable development. While an applicable textbook exists for this liberal arts course, it is noticeable that numerous examples within it are not directly aligned with sustainability concerns. To address this gap, our study strategically integrated the teaching and learning of modeling by carefully selecting classroom examples that closely align with the context of sustainability. By employing an innovative and adaptable approach to the course content delivery, we fostered interdisciplinary collaboration among students, improved their comprehension, and enhanced their interdisciplinary skills. 
Sustainable food is among the many challenges associated with climate change. The resources required to grow or gather the food and the distance it travels to reach the consumer are two key factors of an ingredient's sustainability. Food that is grown locally and is currently "in-season" will have a lower carbon footprint, but when dining out these details unfortunately may not affect one's ordering preferences. We introduce DinAR as an immersive experience to make this information more accessible and to encourage better dining choices through friendly competition with a leaderboard of sustainability scores. Our study measures the effectiveness of immersive AR experiences on impacting consumer preferences towards sustainability. 
The concept of the sustainable business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social, cultural, or other contexts, in a sustainable way. The process of sustainable business model construction forms an innovative part of a business strategy. Different industries and businesses have utilized sustainable business models concept to satisfy their economic, environmental, and social goals simultaneously. However, the success, popularity, and progress of sustainable business models in different application domains are not clear. To explore this issue, this research provides a comprehensive review of sustainable business models literature in various application areas. Notable sustainable business models are identified and further classified in fourteen unique categories, and in every category, the progress -- either failure or success -- has been reviewed, and the research gaps are discussed. Taxonomy of the applications includes innovation, management and marketing, entrepreneurship, energy, fashion, healthcare, agri-food, supply chain management, circular economy, developing countries, engineering, construction and real estate, mobility and transportation, and hospitality. The key contribution of this study is that it provides an insight into the state of the art of sustainable business models in the various application areas and future research directions. This paper concludes that popularity and the success rate of sustainable business models in all application domains have been increased along with the increasing use of advanced technologies. 
The paper proposes the use of green IT as a tool for designing a cloud-oriented sustainable learning environment for a higher education institution. The article substantiates the expediency of designing such an environment as a prerequisite for the sustainable development of Ukraine. It is established that one of the goals of Ukraine's sustainable development for 2030 is to provide fair quality education and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. Green IT is a set of approaches related to sustainable computing and information technology. The work of foreign scientists was analyzed, which considered the issues of designing the learning environment using green computing. As a result, Cloud LMS has been established that cloud LMS is a type of green IT and can serve as a tool for designing a cloud-oriented sustainable learning environment of a higher education institution. A model of a cloud-oriented sustainable learning environment of a higher education institution using cloud LMS is proposed. The application of a cloud-oriented sustainable learning environment will provide such capabilities: keep electronic journals; use on-line services; conduct correspondence, assessment of knowledge on-line; and more. And all of the above is the key to a sustainable development of the learning environment. 
Investing in children and youth is a critical step towards inclusive, equitable, and sustainable development for current and future generations. Several international agendas for accomplishing common global goals emphasize the need for active youth participation and engagement for sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development emphasizes the need for youth engagement and the inclusion of youth perspectives as an important step toward addressing each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The aim of this study is to analyze youth perspectives, values, and sentiments towards issues addressed by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals through social network analysis using machine learning. Social network data collected during 7 major sustainability conferences aimed at engaging children and youth is analyzed using natural language processing techniques for sentiment analysis. This data categorized using a natural language processing text classifier trained on a sample dataset of social network data during the 7 youth sustainability conferences for deeper understanding of youth perspectives in relation to the SDGs. Machine learning identified demographic and location attributes and features are utilized in order to identify bias and demographic differences between ages, gender, and race among youth. Using natural language processing, the qualitative data collected from over 7 different countries in 3 languages are systematically translated, categorized, and analyzed, revealing key trends and focus areas for sustainable youth development policies. The obtained results reveal the general youth's depth of knowledge on sustainable development and their attitudes towards each of the 17 SDGs. The findings of this study serve as a guide toward better understanding the interests, roles, and perspectives of children and youth in achieving the goals of Agenda 2030. 
In response to the transformation towards Industry 5.0, there is a growing call for manufacturing systems that prioritize environmental sustainability, alongside the emerging application of digital tools. Extended Reality (XR) - including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) - is one of the technologies identified as an enabler for Industry 5.0. XR could potentially also be a driver for more sustainable manufacturing: however, its potential environmental benefits have received limited attention. This paper aims to explore the current manufacturing applications and research within the field of XR technology connected to the environmental sustainability principle. The objectives of this paper are two-fold: (1) Identify the currently explored use cases of XR technology in literature and research, addressing environmental sustainability in manufacturing; (2) Provide guidance and references for industry and companies to use cases, toolboxes, methodologies, and workflows for implementing XR in environmental sustainable manufacturing practices. Based on the categorization of sustainability indicators, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the authors analyzed and mapped the current literature, with criteria of pragmatic XR use cases for manufacturing. The exploration resulted in a mapping of the current applications and use cases of XR technology within manufacturing that has the potential to drive environmental sustainability. The results are presented as stated use-cases with reference to the literature, contributing as guidance and inspiration for future researchers or implementations in industry, using XR as a driver for environmental sustainability. Furthermore, the authors open up the discussion for future work and research to increase the attention of XR as a driver for environmental sustainability. 
In this paper, we examine both stability and sustainability of a network-based model of natural resource consumption. Stability is studied from a dynamical systems perspective, though we argue that sustainability is a fundamentally different notion from stability in social-ecological systems. Accordingly, we also present a criterion for sustainability that is guided by the existing literature on sustainable development. Assuming a generic social network of consuming agents' interactions, we derive sufficient conditions for both the stability and sustainability of the model as constraints on the network structure itself. We complement these analytical results with numerical simulations and discuss the implications of our findings for policy-making for sustainable resource governance. 
As we passed the 20th anniversary of the publication of the 12 principles of green chemistry, the sustainable modification of cellulose, being the most abundant biobased polymer, is certainly worth considering. Many researchers work on an efficient valorization of this renewable resource due to its manifold and promising application possibilities, but very often the use of non-sustainable approaches (i.e., solvents, reactants and modification approaches) only addresses the renewability aspect of cellulose, while neglecting most or all of the other principles of green chemistry. In this review, we have employed the use of E-factors together with basic toxicity information to compare between various approaches for homogeneous cellulose modification. This approach, though simple and certainly not overarching, can provide a quick and useful first sustainability assessment. Therefore, in order to achieve a truly sustainable modification of cellulose, its renewability combined with mild and efficient reaction protocols is crucial in order to obtain sustainable materials that are capable of reducing the overall negative impact of today's fossil-based polymeric materials. 
In a so-called overpopulated world, sustainable consumption is of existential importance.However, the expanding spectrum of product choices and their production complexity challenge consumers to make informed and value-sensitive decisions. Recent approaches based on (personalized) psychological manipulation are often intransparent, potentially privacy-invasive and inconsistent with (informational) self-determination. In contrast, responsible consumption based on informed choices currently requires reasoning to an extent that tends to overwhelm human cognitive capacity. As a result, a collective shift towards sustainable consumption remains a grand challenge. Here we demonstrate a novel personal shopping assistant implemented as a smart phone app that supports a value-sensitive design and leverages sustainability awareness, using experts' knowledge and "wisdom of the crowd" for transparent product information and explainable product ratings. Real-world field experiments in two supermarkets confirm higher sustainability awareness and a bottom-up behavioral shift towards more sustainable consumption. These results encourage novel business models for retailers and producers, ethically aligned with consumer preferences and with higher sustainability. 
Following the ideas laid out in Myerson (1996), Hofbauer (2000) defined a Nash equilibrium of a finite game as sustainable if it can be made the unique Nash equilibrium of a game obtained by deleting/adding a subset of the strategies that are inferior replies to it. This paper proves two results about sustainable equilibria. The first concerns the Hofbauer-Myerson conjecture about the relationship between the sustainability of an equilibrium and its index: for a generic class of games, an equilibrium is sustainable iff its index is $+1$. Von Schemde and von Stengel (2008) proved this conjecture for bimatrix games; we show that the conjecture is true for all finite games. More precisely, we prove that an isolated equilibrium has index +1 if and only if it can be made unique in a larger game obtained by adding finitely many strategies that are inferior replies to that equilibrium. Our second result gives an axiomatic extension of sustainability to all games and shows that only the Nash components with positive index can be sustainable. 
Sustainability is an increasingly-studied topic in software engineering in general, and in software architecture in particular. There are already a number of secondary studies addressing sustainability in software engineering, but no such study focusing explicitly on software architecture. This work aims to fill this gap by conducting a systematic mapping study on the intersection between sustainability and software architecture research with the intention of (i) reflecting on the current state of the art, and (ii) identifying the needs for further research. Our results show that, overall, existing works have focused disproportionately on specific aspects of sustainability, and in particular on the most technical and "inward facing" ones. This comes at the expense of the holistic perspective required to address a multi-faceted concern such as sustainability. Furthermore, more reflection-oriented research works, and better coverage of the activities in the architecting life cycle are required to further the maturity of the area. Based on our findings we then propose a research agenda for sustainability-aware software architecture. 
The production, shipping, usage, and disposal of consumer goods have a substantial impact on greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of resources. Modern retail platforms rely heavily on Machine Learning (ML) for their search and recommender systems. Thus, ML can potentially support efforts towards more sustainable consumption patterns, for example, by accounting for sustainability aspects in product search or recommendations. However, leveraging ML potential for reaching sustainability goals requires data on sustainability. Unfortunately, no open and publicly available database integrates sustainability information on a product-by-product basis. In this work, we present the GreenDB, which fills this gap. Based on search logs of millions of users, we prioritize which products users care about most. The GreenDB schema extends the well-known schema.org Product definition and can be readily integrated into existing product catalogs to improve sustainability information available for search and recommendation experiences. We present our proof of concept implementation of a scraping system that creates the GreenDB dataset. 
This article provides a rich discussion on how the sustainability of agile development processes can be enhanced. In particular, we focus on a recently developed framework, named GLUX, that integrates Lean UX into Scrum. GLUX's main goal is to facilitate a seamless integration between agile and user experience (UX) by using gamification to motivate agile teams to adopt a user-centered mindset and carry out UX activities collaboratively throughout the development process. Our role as software researchers is to contribute towards improving software sustainability and provide the software engineering community with the tools and techniques that will improve the human, economic, and environmental sustainability of software development. We found that GLUX addresses human sustainability by empowering self-sufficient, problem-focused teams, building a motivating and engaging environment, and developing team cooperation. Economic sustainability is addressed by minimizing UX debt and using gamification techniques to direct the focus of the behavior and mindset of agile teams towards value creation. Finally, environmental sustainability is promoted by encouraging agile teams to build a minimum viable product (MVP). 
The discussion about the disruptive possibilities of a technology called artificial intelligence (AI) is on everyone's lips. Companies and countries alike are running multi-billion-dollar research programmes to ensure they do not miss out on the global innovation hunt. Among many other applications, AI is also supposed to aid the large-scale changes needed to achieve sustainable societies. To assess those claims and possibilities, this article briefly explains, classifies, and theorises AI technology and then politically contextualises that analysis in light of the sustainability discourse. Based on those insights it finally argues, that AI can play a small role in moving towards sustainable societies, however the fixation on technological innovation, especially AI, obscures and depoliticises the necessary societal decisions regarding sustainability goals and means as mere technicalities and therefore rather obstructs real and effective societal transformation efforts. 
Industry 4.0 and beyond will rely heavily on sustainable Business Decision Modelling (BDM) that can be accelerated by blockchain and Digital Twin (DT) solutions. BDM is built on models and frameworks refined by key identification factors, data analysis, and mathematical or computational aspects applicable to complex business scenarios. Gaining actionable intelligence from collected data for BDM requires a carefully considered infrastructure to ensure data transparency, security, accessibility and sustainability. Organisations should consider social, economic and environmental factors (based on the triple bottom line approach) to ensure sustainability when integrating such an infrastructure. These sustainability features directly impact BDM concerning resource optimisation, stakeholder engagement, regulatory compliance and environmental impacts. To further understand these segments, taxonomies are defined to evaluate blockchain and DT sustainability features based on an in-depth review of the current state-of-the-art research. Detailed comparative evaluations provide insight into the reachability of the sustainable solution in terms of ideologies, access control and performance overheads. Several research questions are put forward to motivate further research that significantly impacts BDM. Finally, a case study based on an exemplary supply chain management system is presented to show the interoperability of blockchain and DT with BDM. 
Internationalization of the higher education has created the so-called borderless university, which provides better opportunities for learning and increases the human and social sustainability. eLearning systems are a special kind of software systems, developed to provide a platform for accessible teaching and learning, including also online access to learning materials and online support for learning and teaching. The aim of our current work is to extract, analyse, and combine the results from multiple studies in order to develop an RE framework for sustainable eLearning systems.   We call a system sustainable, if it has a positive effect on and whose direct and indirect negative impacts resulting from its development, deployment, and usage are minimal. Sustainability has various dimensions. We classify sustainability requirements of eLearning system to five dimensions: individual (human), social, technical, environmental, and economic. In this paper, we focus on human and social aspects (i.e., individual needs the relationship of people within society), as the eLearning systems have a very strong impact on human dimension of sustainability, where their impact on environmental dimension is rather small. This also provides us a basis to identify the corresponding requirements for sustainable eLearning systems. These requirements include collaboration, learner-centred features, leadership development and the reuse of the learning materials. As a result, achieving individual and social requirements for eLearning systems would provide higher quality of leaning and teaching, as well as better opportunities for learning and increasing the human and social sustainability. 
Nowadays, software is pervasive in our everyday lives. Its sustainability and environmental impact have become major factors to be considered in the development of software systems. Millennials-the newer generation of university students-are particularly keen to learn about and contribute to a more sustainable and green society. The need for training on green and sustainable topics in software engineering has been reflected in a number of recent studies. The goal of this paper is to get a first understanding of what is the current state of teaching sustainability in the software engineering community, what are the motivations behind the current state of teaching, and what can be done to improve it. To this end, we report the findings from a targeted survey of 33 academics on the presence of green and sustainable software engineering in higher education. The major findings from the collected data suggest that sustainability is under-represented in the curricula, while the current focus of teaching is on energy efficiency delivered through a fact-based approach. The reasons vary from lack of awareness, teaching material and suitable technologies, to the high effort required to teach sustainability. Finally, we provide recommendations for educators willing to teach sustainability in software engineering that can help to suit millennial students needs. 
The cloud computing paradigm offers on-demand services over the Internet and supports a wide variety of applications. With the recent growth of Internet of Things (IoT) based applications the usage of cloud services is increasing exponentially. The next generation of cloud computing must be energy-efficient and sustainable to fulfil the end-user requirements which are changing dynamically. Presently, cloud providers are facing challenges to ensure the energy efficiency and sustainability of their services. The usage of large number of cloud datacenters increases cost as well as carbon footprints, which further effects the sustainability of cloud services. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of sustainable cloud computing. The taxonomy is used to investigate the existing techniques for sustainability that need careful attention and investigation as proposed by several academic and industry groups. Further, the current research on sustainable cloud computing is organized into several categories: application design, sustainability metrics, capacity planning, energy management, virtualization, thermal-aware scheduling, cooling management, renewable energy and waste heat utilization. The existing techniques have been compared and categorized based on the common characteristics and properties. A conceptual model for sustainable cloud computing has been proposed along with discussion on future research directions. 
Software Engineering is a constantly evolving subject area that faces new challenges every day as it tries to automate newer business processes. One of the key challenges to the success of a software solution is attaining sustainability. The inability of numerous software to sustain for the desired time-length is caused by limited consideration given towards sustainability during the stages of software development. This review aims to present a detailed and inclusive study covering both the technical and non-technical challenges and approaches of software sustainability. A systematic and comprehensive literature review was conducted based on 107 relevant studies that were selected using the Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE) technique. The study showed that sustainability can be achieved by conducting specific activities at the technical and non-technical levels. The technical level consists of software design, coding, and user experience attributes. The non-technical level consists of documentation, sustainability manifestos, training of software engineers, funding software projects, and leadership skills of project managers to achieve sustainability. This paper groups the existing research efforts based on the above aspects. Next, how those aspects affect open and closed source software is tabulated. Based on the findings of this review, it is seen that both technical and non-technical sustainability aspects are equally important, taking one into contention and ignoring the other will threaten the sustenance of software products. 
The Sustainability and Industry Partnership Work Group (SIP-WG) is a part of the National Cancer Institute Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program. The charter of the SIP-WG is to investigate options of long-term sustainability of open source software (OSS) developed by the ITCR, in part by developing a collection of business model archetypes that can serve as sustainability plans for ITCR OSS development initiatives. The workgroup assembled models from the ITCR program, from other studies, and via engagement of its extensive network of relationships with other organizations (e.g., Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Open Source Initiative and Software Sustainability Institute). This article reviews existing sustainability models and describes ten OSS use cases disseminated by the SIP-WG and others, and highlights five essential attributes (alignment with unmet scientific needs, dedicated development team, vibrant user community, feasible licensing model, and sustainable financial model) to assist academic software developers in achieving best practice in software sustainability. 
Sustainable consumption aims to minimize the environmental and societal impact of the use of services and products. Over-consumption of services and products leads to potential natural resource exhaustion and societal inequalities as access to goods and services becomes more challenging. In everyday life, a person can simply achieve more sustainable purchases by drastically changing their lifestyle choices and potentially going against their personal values or wishes. Conversely, achieving sustainable consumption while accounting for personal values is a more complex task as potential trade-offs arise when trying to satisfy environmental and personal goals. This article focuses on value-sensitive design of recommender systems, which enable consumers to improve the sustainability of their purchases while respecting personal and societal values. Value-sensitive recommendations for sustainable consumption are formalized as a multi-objective optimization problem, where each objective represents different sustainability goals and personal values. Novel and existing multi-objective algorithms calculate solutions to this problem. The solutions are proposed as personalized sustainable basket recommendations to consumers. These recommendations are evaluated on a synthetic dataset, which comprises three established real-world datasets from relevant scientific and organizational reports. The synthetic dataset contains quantitative data on product prices, nutritional values, and environmental impact metrics, such as greenhouse gas emissions and water footprint. The recommended baskets are highly similar to consumer purchased baskets and aligned with both sustainability goals and personal values relevant to health, expenditure, and taste. Even when consumers would accept only a fraction of recommendations, a considerable reduction of environmental impact is observed. 
The increasing number of product reviews posted online is a gold mine for designers to know better about the products they develop, by capturing the voice of customers, and to improve these products accordingly. In the meantime, product design and development have an essential role in creating a more sustainable future. With the recent advance of artificial intelligence techniques in the field of natural language processing, this research aims to develop an integrated machine learning solution to obtain sustainable design insights from online product reviews automatically. In this paper, the opportunities and challenges offered by existing frameworks - including Python libraries, packages, as well as state-of-the-art algorithms like BERT - are discussed, illustrated, and positioned along an ad hoc machine learning process. This contribution discusses the opportunities to reach and the challenges to address for building a machine learning pipeline, in order to get insights from product reviews to design more sustainable products, including the five following stages, from the identification of sustainability-related reviews to the interpretation of sustainable design leads: data collection, data formatting, model training, model evaluation, and model deployment. Examples of sustainable design insights that can be produced out of product review mining and processing are given. Finally, promising lines for future research in the field are provided, including case studies putting in parallel standard products with their sustainable alternatives, to compare the features valued by customers and to generate in fine relevant sustainable design leads. 
The production, shipping, usage, and disposal of consumer goods have a substantial impact on greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of resources. Machine Learning (ML) can help to foster sustainable consumption patterns by accounting for sustainability aspects in product search or recommendations of modern retail platforms. However, the lack of large high quality publicly available product data with trustworthy sustainability information impedes the development of ML technology that can help to reach our sustainability goals. Here we present GreenDB, a database that collects products from European online shops on a weekly basis. As proxy for the products' sustainability, it relies on sustainability labels, which are evaluated by experts. The GreenDB schema extends the well-known schema.org Product definition and can be readily integrated into existing product catalogs. We present initial results demonstrating that ML models trained with our data can reliably (F1 score 96%) predict the sustainability label of products. These contributions can help to complement existing e-commerce experiences and ultimately encourage users to more sustainable consumption patterns. 
The overconsumption of consumers under today's increasingly scarce natural resources has overwhelmed the textile industry in middle-income countries, such as Romania. It is becoming more and more essential to encourage sustainable clothing consumption behaviors, such as purchasing recyclable clothes. Notwithstanding there is a limited number of studies trying to understand the intrinsic factors that motivate consumers' purchase intention toward sustainable clothes in middle-income countries. Moreover, the effect of consumers' environmental knowledge on determining their purchase intention of sustainable clothes remains understudied. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to make a significant contribution to the sustainable consumption literature by providing a consolidated framework that explores the behavioral factors inclining Romanian consumers' purchase intention towards sustainable clothes. The foundation of this study combines consumers' social value orientation and the theory of planned behavior. the partial least square path modelling procedure was used to analyze the data of 1,018 Romanian respondents. The findings of this study show that altruistic value orientation, subjective norms, and sustainable attitudes have a positive effect on Romanian consumers' purchase intention of sustainable clothing. Thus, these insights provide essential practical implications of advocating for the consumption of sustainable clothes along with useful guidelines for practitioners in the textile industry among middle-income countries, especially in Romania, to reduce overconsumption. 
The purpose of this research was to identify commonly adopted SAPs and their adoption among Kentucky farmers. The specific objectives were to explore farmers' Perceptions about farm and farming practice sustainability, to identify predictors of SAPs adoption using farm attributes, farmers' attitudes and behaviors, socioeconomic and demographic factors, and knowledge, and to evaluate adoption barriers of SAPs among Kentucky Farmers. Farmers generally perceive that their farm and farming activities attain the objectives of sustainable agriculture. Inadequate knowledge, perceived difficulty of implementation, lack of market, negative attitude about technologies, and lack of technologies were major adoption barriers of SAPs in Kentucky. 
I study repeated games with anonymous random matching where players endogenously decide whether to disclose signals about their past actions. I establish an-anti folk theorem, that when players are sufficiently long-lived, they will almost always play their dominant actions and will almost never cooperate. When players' expected lifespans are intermediate, they can sustain some cooperation if their actions are substitutes but cannot sustain any cooperation if their actions are complements. Therefore, the maximal level of cooperation a community can sustain is not monotone with respect to its members' expected lifespans and the complementarity of players' actions can undermine their abilities to sustain cooperation. 
This paper introduces and defines a novel concept in sustainable investing, termed crosswashing, and explore its impact on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ratings through quantitative analysis using a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model. The study emphasises that this specific form of greenwashing is not currently considered in existing ESG assessments, potentially leading to an inflated perception of corporate ethical practices. Unlike traditional greenwashing, crosswashing involves companies strategically investing in sustainable activities to boost Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores while preserving nonsustainable core operations. By unveiling the nuances of crosswashing, the research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of sustainable investing, offering insights for improved evaluation and regulation of corporate environmental and ethical responsibilities. 
Education for sustainable development has evolved to include more constructive approaches and a better understanding of what is needed to align education with the cultural, societal, and pedagogical changes required to avoid the risks posed by an unsustainable society. This evolution aims to lead us toward viable, equitable, and sustainable futures. However, computing education, including software engineering, is not fully aligned with the current understanding of what is needed for transformational learning in light of our current challenges. This is partly because computing is primarily seen as a technical field, focused on industry needs. Until recently, sustainability was not a high priority for most businesses, including the digital sector, nor was it a prominent focus for higher education institutions and society.   Given these challenges, we aim to propose a research roadmap to integrate sustainability principles and essential skills into the crowded computing curriculum, nurturing future software engineering professionals with a sustainability mindset. We conducted two extensive studies: a systematic review of academic literature on sustainability in computing education and a survey of industry professionals on their interest in sustainability and desired skills for graduates. Using insights from these studies, we identified key topics for teaching sustainability, including core sustainability principles, values and ethics, systems thinking, impact measurement, soft skills, business value, legal standards, and advocacy. Based on these findings, we will develop recommendations for future computing education programs that emphasise sustainability.   The paper is accepted at the 2030 Software Engineering workshop, which is co-located with the FSE'24 conference. 
The scientific data about the state of our planet, presented at the 2012 (Rio+20) summit, documented that today's human family lives even less sustainably than it did in 1992. The data indicate furthermore that the environmental impacts from our current economic activities are so large, that we are approaching situations where potentially controllable regional problems can easily lead to uncontrollable global disasters.   Assuming that (1) the majority of the human family, once adequately informed, wants to achieve a "sustainable way of life" and (2) that the "development towards sustainability" roadmap will be based on scientific principles, one must begin with unambiguous and quantifiable definitions of these goals. As will be demonstrated, the well known scientific method to define abstract and complex issues by their negation, satisfies these requirements. Following this new approach, it also becomes possible to decide if proposed and actual policies changes will make our way of life less unsustainable, and thus move us potentially into the direction of sustainability. Furthermore, if potentially dangerous tipping points are to be avoided, the transition roadmap must include some minimal speed requirements. Combining the negation method and the time evolution of that remaining natural capital in different domains, the transition speed for a "development towards sustainability" can be quantified at local, regional and global scales.   The presented ideas allow us to measure the rate of natural capital depletion and the rate of restoration that will be required if humanity is to avoid reaching a sustainable future by a collapse transition. 
Although OSS development is very popular, ultimately more than 80 percent of OSS projects fail. Identifying the factors associated with OSS success can help in devising interventions when a project takes a downturn. OSS success has been studied from a variety of angles, more recently in empirical studies of large numbers of diverse projects, using proxies for sustainability, e.g., internal metrics related to productivity and external ones, related to community popularity. The internal socio-technical structure of projects has also been shown important, especially their dynamics. This points to another angle on evaluating software success, from the perspective of self-sustaining and self-governing communities.   To uncover the dynamics of how a project at a nascent development stage gradually evolves into a sustainable one, here we apply a socio-technical network modeling perspective to a dataset of Apache Software Foundation Incubator (ASFI), sustainability-labeled projects. To identify and validate the determinants of sustainability, we undertake a mix of quantitative and qualitative studies of ASFI projects' socio-technical network trajectories. We develop interpretable models which can forecast a project becoming sustainable with more than 93 percent accuracy, within 8 months of incubation start. Based on the interpretable models we describe a strategy for real-time monitoring and suggesting actions, which can be used by projects to correct their sustainability trajectories. 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast-growing research and development (R&D) discipline which is attracting increasing attention because of its promises to bring vast benefits for consumers and businesses, with considerable benefits promised in productivity growth and innovation. To date it has reported significant accomplishments in many areas that have been deemed as challenging for machines, ranging from computer vision, natural language processing, audio analysis to smart sensing and many others. The technical trend in realizing the successes has been towards increasing complex and large size AI models so as to solve more complex problems at superior performance and robustness. This rapid progress, however, has taken place at the expense of substantial environmental costs and resources. Besides, debates on the societal impacts of AI, such as fairness, safety and privacy, have continued to grow in intensity. These issues have presented major concerns pertaining to the sustainable development of AI. In this work, we review major trends in machine learning approaches that can address the sustainability problem of AI. Specifically, we examine emerging AI methodologies and algorithms for addressing the sustainability issue of AI in two major aspects, i.e., environmental sustainability and social sustainability of AI. We will also highlight the major limitations of existing studies and propose potential research challenges and directions for the development of next generation of sustainable AI techniques. We believe that this technical review can help to promote a sustainable development of AI R&D activities for the research community. 
Background: Sustainable software engineering (SSE) means creating software in a way that meets present needs without undermining our collective capacity to meet our future needs. It is typically conceptualized as several intersecting dimensions or ``pillars'' -- environmental, social, economic, technical and individual. However; these pillars are theoretically underdeveloped and require refinement. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to generate a better theory of SSE. Method: First, a scoping review was conducted to understand the state of research on SSE and identify existing models thereof. Next, a meta-synthesis of qualitative research on SSE was conducted to critique and improve the existing models identified. Results: 961 potentially relevant articles were extracted from five article databases. These articles were de-duplicated and then screened independently by two screeners, leaving 243 articles to examine. Of these, 109 were non-empirical, the most common empirical method was systematic review, and no randomized controlled experiments were found. Most papers focus on ecological sustainability (158) and the sustainability of software products (148) rather than processes. A meta-synthesis of 36 qualitative studies produced several key propositions, most notably, that sustainability is stratified (has different meanings at different levels of abstraction) and multisystemic (emerges from interactions among multiple social, technical, and sociotechnical systems). Conclusion: The academic literature on SSE is surprisingly non-empirical. More empirical evaluations of specific sustainability interventions are needed. The sustainability of software development products and processes should be conceptualized as multisystemic and stratified, and assessed accordingly. 
Sustainable development is a framework for achieving human development goals. It provides natural systems' ability to deliver natural resources and ecosystem services. Sustainable development is crucial for the economy and society. Artificial intelligence (AI) has attracted increasing attention in recent years, with the potential to have a positive influence across many domains. AI is a commonly employed component in the quest for long-term sustainability. In this study, we explore the impact of AI on three pillars of sustainable development: society, environment, and economy, as well as numerous case studies from which we may deduce the impact of AI in a variety of areas, i.e., agriculture, classifying waste, smart water management, and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Furthermore, we present AI-based strategies for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which are effective for developing countries like Bangladesh. The framework that we propose may reduce the negative impact of AI and promote the proactiveness of this technology. 
The sustainable development of next-generation device technology is paramount in the face of climate change and the looming energy crisis. Tremendous efforts have been made in the discovery and design of nanomaterials that achieve device-level sustainability, where high performance and low operational energy cost are prioritized. However, many of such materials are composed of elements that are under threat of depletion and pose elevated risks to the environment. The role of material-level sustainability in computational screening efforts remains an open question thus far. Here we develop a general van der Waals materials screening framework imbued with sustainability-motivated search criteria. Using ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) materials as a backdrop -- an emerging materials class with great prospects in dielectric, power electronics, and ultraviolet device applications, we demonstrate how this screening framework results in 25 sustainable UWBG layered materials comprising only of low-risks elements. Our findings constitute a critical first-step towards reinventing a more sustainable electronics landscape beyond silicon, with the framework established in this work serving as a harbinger of sustainable 2D materials discovery. 
From its conception, 6G is being designed with a particular focus on sustainability. The general philosophy of the H2020 Hexa-X project work on sustainability in 6G is based on two principles: to reduce direct negative life cycle impacts of 6G systems as much as possible (Sustainable 6G) and to analyze use cases that maximize positive environmental, social, and economic effects in other sectors of society (6G for Sustainability or its enablement effect). To apply this philosophy, Hexa-X is designing 6G with three sustainability objectives in mind: to enable the reduction of emissions in 6G-powered sectors of society, to reduce the total cost of ownership and to improve energy efficiency. This paper describes these objectives, their associated KPIs and quantitative targets, and the levers to reach them. Furthermore, to maximize the positive effects of 6G through the enablement effect, a link between 6G and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) framework is proposed and illustrated by Hexa-X use case families. 
Context: Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities' ability to stay viable and productive over time is pivotal for society as they maintain the building blocks that digital infrastructure, products, and services depend on. Sustainability may, however, be characterized from multiple aspects, and less is known how these aspects interplay and impact community outputs, and software quality specifically.   Objective: This study, therefore, aims to empirically explore how the different aspects of FOSS sustainability impact software quality.   Method: 16 sustainability metrics across four categories were sampled and applied to a set of 217 OSS projects sourced from the Apache Software Foundation Incubator program. The impact of a decline in the sustainability metrics was analyzed against eight software quality metrics using Bayesian data analysis, which incorporates probability distributions to represent the regression coefficients and intercepts.   Results: Findings suggest that selected sustainability metrics do not significantly affect defect density or code coverage. However, a positive impact of community age was observed on specific code quality metrics, such as risk complexity, number of very large files, and code duplication percentage. Interestingly, findings show that even when communities are experiencing sustainability, certain code quality metrics are negatively impacted.   Conclusion: Findings imply that code quality practices are not consistently linked to sustainability, and defect management and prevention may be prioritized over the former. Results suggest that growth, resulting in a more complex and large codebase, combined with a probable lack of understanding of code quality standards, may explain the degradation in certain aspects of code quality. 
We consider the effects of Gravity's Rainbow on the self-sustained equation which is responsible to find new traversable wormholes configurations which are sustained by their own gravitational quantum fluctuations. The same self-sustained equation is also used to discover if topology change is possible. In this contribution, we will show that in both uses, the self-sustained equation will produce a Wheeler wormhole, namely a wormhole of Planckian size. This means that, from the point of view of traversability, the wormhole will be traversable in principle, but not in practice. From the topology change point of view, the background metric will be fixed to be Minkowskian in the equation governing the quantum fluctuations, which behaves essentially as a backreaction equation, and the quantum fluctuations are let to evolve. Analyzing this procedure, we will show that the self-sustained equation, endowed with a Gravity's Rainbow distortion, will be responsible of a topology change with the appearance of a Planckian wormhole. 
We study a mechanism of activity sustaining on networks inspired by a well-known model of neuronal dynamics. Our primary focus is the emergence of self-sustaining collective activity patterns, where no single node can stay active by itself, but the activity provided initially is sustained within the collective of interacting agents. In contrast to existing models of self-sustaining activity that are caused by (long) loops present in the network, here we focus on tree--like structures and examine activation mechanisms that are due to temporal memory of the nodes. This approach is motivated by applications in social media, where long network loops are rare or absent. Our results suggest that under a weak behavioral noise, the nodes robustly split into several clusters, with partial synchronization of nodes within each cluster. We also study the randomly-weighted version of the models where the nodes are allowed to change their connection strength (this can model attention redistribution), and show that it does facilitate the self-sustained activity. 
Complex software systems must be maintained for years or decades, and the effort and cost to maintain them are often high, involving continuous refactoring to ensure their longevity in the face of changing requirements. In this article, we introduce the notion of architectural knowledge (AK) sustainability as a new concept to support architects dealing with the evolution of long-lived systems. Architecture sustainability refers to the ability of the architecture to endure over time with the minimum number of refactoring cycles possible. We suggest that sustainability of the AK is a function of how stable the decisions are, and we discuss a set of sustainability criteria and metrics useful to estimate the sustainability of this AK. 
It is shown that quantum sustainability is a universal phenomenon which emerges during environment-assisted electronic excitation energy transfer (EET) in photobiological complexes (PBCs), such as photosynthetic reaction centers and centers of melanogenesis. We demonstrate that quantum photobiological systems must be sustainable for them to simultaneously endure continuous energy transfer and keep their internal structure from destruction or critical instability. These quantum effects occur due to the interaction of PBCs with their environment which can be described by means of the reduced density operator and effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NH). Sustainable NH models of EET predict the coherence beats, followed by the decrease of coherence down to a small, yet non-zero value. This indicates that in sustainable PBCs, quantum effects survive on a much larger time scale than the energy relaxation of an exciton. We show that sustainable evolution significantly lowers the entropy of PBCs and improves the speed and capacity of EET. 
Business processes need to have certain constraints such that they can lead to sustainable outcomes. These constraints can be manifold and their adherence has to be monitored. In the past compliance checking has been applied in several business domains without considering certain sustainability aspects, such as multi-dimensionality and impact level. With my research I want to contribute to the application of compliance checking techniques for the purpose of sustainability compliance. In order to achieve this, I want to analyse and develop data-driven approaches, which allow to automate the task of compliance checking. The way in which this can be achieved, is be combining methods from process mining with formal languages that can express sustainability rules in a machine-readable manner. The main goal is to develop a compliance engine that can be adapted by ERP systems in order to evaluate sustainability conformance in business processes. 
Internet of Things is one of the driving technologies behind the concept of Smart Cities and is capable of playing a significant role in facilitating urban sustainable development. This chapter explores the relationship between three core concepts namely Smart Cities, Internet of Things and Sustainability; thereby identifying the challenges and opportunities that exist in the synergistic use of Internet of Things for sustainability, in the Smart Cities context. Moreover, this chapter also presents some of the existing use cases that apply Internet of Things for urban sustainable development, also presenting the vision for these applications as they continue to evolve in and adapt to the real world scenario. It is because of the interdisciplinary nature of these applications that a clear comprehension of the associated challenges becomes quintessential. Study of challenges and opportunities in this area shall facilitate collaboration between different sectors of urban planning and optimize the utilization of Internet of Things for sustainability. 
Understanding sustainability through modeling involves one of the complex and interdisciplinary activities where mathematics plays a key role. We provide arguments favoring the need for developing global models for measuring the status of sustainability. A global model (applicable in broader perspective) and global sustainability indices are proposed which can be used with real-world data. The solutions of the proposed Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are blended with the weight functions of Riemann Stieltjes integrals to capture the differential importance of sustainability associated factors. The ideas, methods, and models are new and are prepared for handling multi-dimensional and multi-variate data. A practically adaptable formula for measuring the sustainability index is developed with few key variables. We provide a real-world example arising in civil engineering applications with a numerical example to demonstrate our models. 
Sustainability reporting enables investors to make informed decisions and is hoped to facilitate the transition to a green economy. The European Union's taxonomy regulation enacts rules to discern sustainable activities and determine the resulting green revenue, whose disclosure is mandatory for many companies. In an experiment, we explore how this standardized metric is received by investors relative to a sustainability rating. We find that green revenue affects the investment probability more than the rating if the two metrics disagree. If they agree, a strong rating has an incremental effect on the investment probability. The effects are robust to variation in investors' attitudes. Our findings imply that a mandatory standardized sustainability metric is an effective means of channeling investment, which complements rather than substitutes sustainability ratings. 
Sequential recommender systems have shown effective suggestions by capturing users' interest drift. There have been two groups of existing sequential models: user- and item-centric models. The user-centric models capture personalized interest drift based on each user's sequential consumption history, but do not explicitly consider whether users' interest in items sustains beyond the training time, i.e., interest sustainability. On the other hand, the item-centric models consider whether users' general interest sustains after the training time, but it is not personalized. In this work, we propose a recommender system taking advantages of the models in both categories. Our proposed model captures personalized interest sustainability, indicating whether each user's interest in items will sustain beyond the training time or not. We first formulate a task that requires to predict which items each user will consume in the recent period of the training time based on users' consumption history. We then propose simple yet effective schemes to augment users' sparse consumption history. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model outperforms 10 baseline models on 11 real-world datasets. The codes are available at https://github.com/dmhyun/PERIS. 
Universities are racing towards making their campuses and cities smart in response to the global digitalization trend. However, the sustainability impact of Smart Campus research, development, and innovation services on other relevant stakeholders such as the small and medium-sized businesses, remain under-investigated. The Finnish National Smart Campus project seeks to bridge this gap by orchestrating a SC ecosystem where eight SC collaborate to bring trailblazing services to businesses and society. To maximize the sustainability impact of the SC ecosystem, this study used a participatory workshop to identify the challenges of SC, provide a step-by-step guide on how to identify other relevant stakeholders, and ascertain the perceived sustainability impact using one of the SC ecosystems RDIs as a case study. The preliminary results revealed that barriers to university-industry ecosystem development include (i), the lack of clarity in the shared goals (i.e., value proposition) between actors and (ii), weak stakeholder involvement in university RDI processes. Finally, this paper proposed a SC ecosystem model which offers a mindset shift for higher educational institutions in promoting the convergence of SC services and sustainability to support the sustainable development of Finnish-based SMEs. 
AI is transforming the existing technology landscape at a rapid phase enabling data-informed decision making and autonomous decision making. Unlike any other technology, because of the decision-making ability of AI, ethics and governance became a key concern. There are many emerging AI risks for humanity, such as autonomous weapons, automation-spurred job loss, socio-economic inequality, bias caused by data and algorithms, privacy violations and deepfakes. Social diversity, equity and inclusion are considered key success factors of AI to mitigate risks, create values and drive social justice. Sustainability became a broad and complex topic entangled with AI. Many organizations (government, corporate, not-for-profits, charities and NGOs) have diversified strategies driving AI for business optimization and social-and-environmental justice. Partnerships and collaborations become important more than ever for equity and inclusion of diversified and distributed people, data and capabilities. Therefore, in our journey towards an AI-enabled sustainable future, we need to address AI ethics and governance as a priority. These AI ethics and governance should be underpinned by human ethics. 
To fight climate change and accommodate the increasing population, global crop production has to be strengthened. To achieve the "sustainable intensification" of agriculture, transforming it from carbon emitter to carbon sink is a priority, and understanding the environmental impact of agricultural management practices is a fundamental prerequisite to that. At the same time, the global agricultural landscape is deeply heterogeneous, with differences in climate, soil, and land use inducing variations in how agricultural systems respond to farmer actions. The "personalization" of sustainable agriculture with the provision of locally adapted management advice is thus a necessary condition for the efficient uplift of green metrics, and an integral development in imminent policies. Here, we formulate personalized sustainable agriculture as a Conditional Average Treatment Effect estimation task and use Causal Machine Learning for tackling it. Leveraging climate data, land use information and employing Double Machine Learning, we estimate the heterogeneous effect of sustainable practices on the field-level Soil Organic Carbon content in Lithuania. We thus provide a data-driven perspective for targeting sustainable practices and effectively expanding the global carbon sink. 
The production of goods we buy on a daily basis accounts for a large portion of greenhouse gas emissions. Although consumers have the power to influence industries' behavior through their demand, making sustainable purchases is challenging. Current ICT systems supporting sustainable shopping decisions are not established in consumers' daily lifes. Shopping decisions are made on a complex set of criteria, thus classical persuasive approaches, like recommender-systems, might not be suitable. This work compiles the state of research on ICT supporting sustainable consumption, outlines unsolved challenges, and finally presents a novel concept: a system based on self-reflection instead of classical persuasive approaches, like recommender-systems. Self-reflection provokes revising individual behaviour and decisions, instead of presenting instructions. Combined with additional information on e.g., decision impact, people could learn how to make more sustainable decisions independently. We envision the deployment of such a system, fostering a change towards more sustainable industries to combat climate change. 
Economic Complexity (EC) methods have gained increasing popularity across fields and disciplines. In particular, the EC toolbox has proved particularly promising in the study of complex and interrelated phenomena, such as the transition towards a greener economy. Using the EC approach, scholars have been investigating the relationship between EC and sustainability, proposing to identify the distinguishing characteristics of green products and to assess the readiness of productive and technological structures for the sustainability transition. This article proposes to review and summarize the data, methods, and empirical literature that are relevant to the study of the sustainability transition from an EC perspective. We review three distinct but connected blocks of literature on EC and environmental sustainability. First, we survey the evidence linking measures of EC to indicators related to environmental sustainability. Second, we review articles that strive to assess the green competitiveness of productive systems. Third, we examine evidence on green technological development and its connection to non-green knowledge bases. Finally, we summarize the findings for each block and identify avenues for further research in this recent and growing body of empirical literature. 
Every day we face numerous lifestyle decisions, some dictated by habits and some more conscious, which may or may not promote sustainable living. Aided by digital technology, sustainable behaviors can diffuse within social groups and inclusive communities. This paper outlines a longitudinal experimental study of social influence in behavioral changes toward sustainability, in the context of smart residential homes. Participants are residing in the housing on campus referred to as KTH Live-In Lab, whose behaviors are observed w.r.t. key lifestyle choices, such as food, resources, mobility, consumption, and environmental citizenship. The focus is on the preparatory phase of the case study and the challenges and limitations encountered during its setup. In particular, this work proposes a definition of sustainability indicators for environmentally significant behaviors, and hypothesizes that, through digitalization of a household into a social network of interacting tenants, sustainable living can be promoted. Preliminary results confirm the feasibility of the proposed experimental methodology. 
Sustainable development has emerged as a global priority, and industries are increasingly striving to align their operations with sustainable practices. Parallel machine scheduling (PMS) is a critical aspect of production planning that directly impacts resource utilization and operational efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the application of metaheuristic optimization algorithms to address the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem (UPMSP) through the lens of sustainable development goals (SDGs). The primary objective of this study is to explore how metaheuristic optimization algorithms can contribute to achieving sustainable development goals in the context of UPMSP. We examine a range of metaheuristic algorithms, including genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, and more, and assess their effectiveness in optimizing the scheduling problem. The algorithms are evaluated based on their ability to improve resource utilization, minimize energy consumption, reduce environmental impact, and promote socially responsible production practices. To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we consider UPMSP instances that incorporate sustainability-related constraints and objectives. 
As AI/ML models, including Large Language Models, continue to scale with massive datasets, so does their consumption of undeniably limited natural resources, and impact on society. In this collaboration between AI, Sustainability, HCI and legal researchers, we aim to enable a transition to sustainable AI development by enabling stakeholders across the AI value chain to assess and quantitfy the environmental and societal impact of AI. We present the ESG Digital and Green Index (DGI), which offers a dashboard for assessing a company's performance in achieving sustainability targets. This includes monitoring the efficiency and sustainable use of limited natural resources related to AI technologies (water, electricity, etc). It also addresses the societal and governance challenges related to AI. The DGI creates incentives for companies to align their pathway with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The value, challenges and limitations of our methodology and findings are discussed in the paper. 
Scientific open-source software (OSS) has greatly benefited research communities through its transparent and collaborative nature. Given its critical role in scientific research, ensuring the sustainability of such software has become vital. Earlier studies have proposed sustainability strategies for conventional scientific software and open-source communities. However, it remains unclear whether these solutions can be easily adapted to the integrated framework of scientific OSS and its larger ecosystem. This study examines the challenges and opportunities to enhance the sustainability of scientific OSS in the context of interdisciplinary collaboration, open-source community, and multi-project ecosystem. We conducted a case study on a widely-used software ecosystem in the astrophysics domain, the Astropy Project, using a mixed-methods design approach. This approach includes an interview with core contributors regarding their participation in an interdisciplinary team, a survey of disengaged contributors about their motivations for contribution, reasons for disengagement, and suggestions for sustaining the communities, and finally, an analysis of cross-referenced issues and pull requests to understand best practices for collaboration on the ecosystem level. Our study reveals the implications of major challenges for sustaining scientific OSS and proposes concrete suggestions for tackling these challenges. 
This study aims to develop a framework for multicriteria analysis to evaluate alternatives for sustainable corn agricultural area planning, considering the integration of ecological, economic, and social aspects as pillars of sustainability. The research method uses qualitative and quantitative approaches to integrate ecological, economic, and social aspects in the multicriteria analysis. The analysis involves land evaluation, subcriteria identification, and data integration using Multidimensional Scaling and Analytical Hierarchy Process methods to prioritize developing sustainable corn agricultural areas. Based on the results of the RAP-Corn analysis, it indicates that the ecological dimension depicts less sustainability. The AHP results yield weight distribution and highly relevant scores that describe tangible preferences. Priority directions are grouped as strategic steps toward achieving the goals of sustainable corn agricultural area planning. 
Given the continuous global degradation of the Earth's ecosystem due to unsustainable human activity, it is increasingly important for enterprises to evaluate the effects they have on the environment. Consequently, assessing the impact of business processes on sustainability is becoming an important consideration in the discipline of Business Process Management (BPM). However, existing practical approaches that aim at a sustainability-oriented analysis of business processes provide only a limited perspective on the environmental impact caused. Further, they provide no clear and practically applicable mechanism for sustainability-driven process analysis and re-design. Following a design science methodology, we here propose and study SOPA, a framework for sustainability-oriented process analysis and re-design. SOPA extends the BPM life cycle by use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for sustainability analysis in combination with Activity-based Costing (ABC). We evaluate SOPA and its usefulness with a case study, by means of an implementation to support the approach, thereby also illustrating the practical applicability of this work. 
Software intensive systems play a crucial role in most, if not all, aspects of modern society. As such, both their sustainability and their role in supporting sustainable processes, must be realized by design. To this aim, the architecture of software intensive systems should be designed to support sustainability goals; and measured to understand how effectively they do so. In this paper, we present the Sustainability Assessment Framework (SAF) Toolkit -- a set of instruments that support architects and design decision makers in modeling sustainability as a software quality property. The SAF Toolkit is the result of our experience gained in over a decade of cases in collaboration with industrial partners. We illustrate the toolkit with examples stemming from various cases. We extract our lessons learned, and our current research and future plans to extend the SAF Toolkit for further architecture modeling and measurement. 
Previous research has raised concerns about energy droughts in renewables-based energy systems. This study explores the ability of reservoir hydropower to sustain a high output and, thereby, mitigate such energy droughts. Using detailed modelling, we estimate that Swedish hydropower can sustain 67-92% of its installed capacity for 3 weeks, with higher values possible in springtime. The variation of the sustained output, equivalent to the capacity of 3-4 Swedish nuclear reactors, under-scores the importance of understanding the potential output levels when devising strategies to counteract energy droughts. Moreover, we find that regulations imposed on the flows in river bottlenecks hinder higher sustained output levels. With the upcoming renewal of environmental permits for hydropower plants in Sweden, these findings provide valuable insights for policymakers. Furthermore, the sustained output capabilities demonstrated in this study challenge the prevalent simplified representations of hydropower in energy models, suggesting a need for more-sophisticated modelling approaches. 
The adoption of cloud computing is steadily increasing in designing and implementing software systems, thus it becomes imperative to consider the sustainability implications of these processes. While there has already been some academic research on this topic, there is a lack of perspective from practitioners. To bridge this gap, we utilize software repository mining techniques to examine 192 discussions among practitioners on the Software Engineering forum of the StackExchange platform, aiming to build an annotated dataset containing cloud architectural discussions and to understand the current discussion on sustainability in cloud architecture. To identify these discussions, we first put together a list of terms indicating sustainability as the topic. Our initial findings indicate practitioners mainly focus on design aspects (analysis, synthesis, and implementation) while avoiding complex activities like evaluation and maintenance. Technical sustainability is emphasized, while the economic dimension has the most discussions exclusively focused on it. This contrasts with previous academic literature, which highlighted environmental sustainability. 
The sustainable foraging problem is a dynamic environment testbed for exploring the forms of agent cognition in dealing with social dilemmas in a multi-agent setting. The agents need to resist the temptation of individual rewards through foraging and choose the collective long-term goal of sustainability. We investigate methods of online learning in Neuro-Evolution and Deep Recurrent Q-Networks to enable agents to attempt the problem one-shot as is often required by wicked social problems. We further explore if learning temporal dependencies with Long Short-Term Memory may be able to aid the agents in developing sustainable foraging strategies in the long term. It was found that the integration of Long Short-Term Memory assisted agents in developing sustainable strategies for a single agent, however failed to assist agents in managing the social dilemma that arises in the multi-agent scenario. 
Security and safety are intertwined concepts in the world of computing. In recent years, the terms "sustainable security" and "sustainable safety" came into fashion and are being used referring to a variety of systems properties ranging from efficiency to profitability, and sometimes meaning that a product or service is good for people and planet. This leads to confusing perceptions of products where customers might expect a sustainable product to be developed without child labour, while the producer uses the term to signify that their new product uses marginally less power than the previous generation of that products. Even in research on sustainably safe and secure ICT, these different notions of terminology are prevalent. As researchers we often work towards optimising our subject of study towards one specific sustainability metric - let's say energy consumption - while being blissfully unaware of, e.g., social impacts, life-cycle impacts, or rebound effects of such optimisations.   In this paper I dissect the idea of sustainable safety and security, starting from the questions of what we want to sustain, and for whom we want to sustain it. I believe that a general "people and planet" answer is inadequate here because this form of sustainability cannot be the property of a single industry sector but must be addressed by society as a whole. However, with sufficient understanding of life-cycle impacts we may very well be able to devise research and development efforts, and inform decision making processes towards the use of integrated safety and security solutions that help us to address societal challenges in the context of the climate and ecological crises, and that are aligned with concepts such as intersectionality and climate justice. Of course, these solutions can only be effective if they are embedded in societal and economic change towards more frugal uses of data and ICT. 
Although the open source model bears many advantages in software development, open source projects are always hard to sustain. Previous research on open source sustainability mainly focuses on projects that have already reached a certain level of maturity (e.g., with communities, releases, and downstream projects). However, limited attention is paid to the development of (sustainable) open source projects in their infancy, and we believe an understanding of early sustainability determinants is crucial for project initiators, incubators, newcomers, and users.   In this paper, we aim to explore the relationship between early participation factors and long-term project sustainability. We leverage a novel methodology combining the Blumberg model of performance and machine learning to predict the sustainability of 290,255 GitHub projects. Specificially, we train an XGBoost model based on early participation (first three months of activity) in 290,255 GitHub projects and we interpret the model using LIME. We quantitatively show that early participants have a positive effect on project's future sustained activity if they have prior experience in OSS project incubation and demonstrate concentrated focus and steady commitment. Participation from non-code contributors and detailed contribution documentation also promote project's sustained activity. Compared with individual projects, building a community that consists of more experienced core developers and more active peripheral developers is important for organizational projects. This study provides unique insights into the incubation and recognition of sustainable open source projects, and our interpretable prediction approach can also offer guidance to open source project initiators and newcomers. 
This paper sketches a new approach using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to operably map and simulate digital transformation in architecture and urban planning. Today these processes are poorly understood. Many current studies on digital transformation are only treating questions of economic efficiency. Sustainability and social impact only play a minor role. Decisive definitions, concepts and terms stay unclear. Therefore this paper develops an open experimental testbed for sustainable and innovative environments (ETSIE) for three different digital transformation scenarios using FCMs. A traditional growth-oriented scenario, a COVID-19 scenario and an innovative and sustainable COVID-19 scenario are modeled and tested. All three scenarios have the same number of components, connections and the same driver components. Only the initial state vectors are different and the internal correlations are weighted differently. This allows for comparing all three scenarios on an equal basis. The mental modeler software is used (Gray et al. 2013). This paper presents one of the first applications of FCMs in the context of digital transformation. It is shown, that the traditional growth-oriented scenario is structurally very similar to the current COVID-19 scenario. The current pandemic is able to accelerate digital transformation to a certain extent. But the pandemic does not guarantee for a distinct sustainable and innovative future development. Only by changing the initial state vectors and the weights of the connections an innovative and sustainable turnaround in a third scenario becomes possible. 
This paper addresses the struggle of rural micro-entrepreneurs in the Global South in utilizing e-commerce to reach wider markets. This research paper looks at the adoption of e-commerce as a sustainable marketplace by the micro-entrepreneur sellers from the lower socio-economic rural communities in India, a booming digital economy in the Global South. 'Sustainability' here refers to a model for sustainable economic development sustaining the e-commerce as business model for the rural micro-entrepreneurs to flourish. This paper explores rural development by dismantling the factors that shape the ways technology and trade impact micro-entrepreneurs. The aim is to offer recommendations and solutions to contribute building the e-commerce as a sustainable marketplace for rural micro-entrepreneurs. Recent information and economic policy changes in India, along with the expansion of mobile infrastructure and a growing user base in rural regions makes this research timely and important. By scrutinizing the infrastructure and auditing the information needs and challenges of users, this research will illuminate the gaps that are leading to a lack of sustainable economic development, and information asymmetries discouraging the rural micro-entrepreneurs from selling online. The purpose of the paper is to find hurdles in the sustainable development of e-commerce as a business solution. 
Governments in sub-Saharan Africa have implemented e-Government projects. Actualizing the value propositions and sustaining such values are becoming problematic. Some scanty studies on the value propositions of implemented e-Government projects did not consider actualization of the values. Besides, such studies lack theoretical underpinnings, the identification, and measure of what constitutes actualized values. Neither did they capture what mechanisms could sustain the actualized values nor the contextual conditions enabling its sustainability. Consequently, using a concept-centric systematic review, we identified the value proposition of such implemented projects. By drawing from theories of affordance actualization, realist evaluation (RE) theory, self-determination theory, and sustainability framework for e-Government success. We conducted a RE of the implemented e-Government projects in Rwanda using RE as a methodology in three phases. In phase one, we developed the initial program theory (IPT), in phase two, we used contingent valuation as a quantitative approach and realist interview as qualitative method to validate the IPT. Lastly, in the third phase, we synthesized the results of the two investigative case studies to develop the actualized values sustainability framework. Such framework encapsulates, the actualized value propositions, mechanisms and enabling conditions in interactions to sustain the value propositions discovered in the e-Government investigative contexts. 
Sustainability aspects of transportation infrastructure systems primarily focus on system performance based on environmental, social, and economic impacts. In contrast, resilience aspects demonstrate the ability to withstand external shocks i.e. robustness as well as to recover from the loss of functionality due to such disruptions i.e. rapidity. Therefore, sustainability and resilience are two key aspects which should be given adequate attention during the planning, design, construction, operations, and maintenance phases of any civil infrastructure system. As both concepts are equally important to sustain an infrastructure for a longer duration, their concurrent assessments within a unified framework are highly desirable. While there has been a recent focus towards solving this dilemma, review of existing studies revealed the lack of such unifying frameworks that can quantify sustainability and resilience indicators to simultaneously assess system performance. Moreover, a single decision or performance indicator could reinforce one and undermine another. As such, this study proposed a forward-looking unification framework, where the sustainability and resilience of transportation infrastructure systems can be analyzed simultaneously. In this regard, the proposed unifying framework is explained using seven critical indicators including emission, speed, temperature, energy consumption, delay, mobility, and accessibility. This study also investigates the interdependencies, relationships, and tradeoffs between sustainability and resilience based on these indices. While some indices would help the system to attain both at the same time, they are compromised in some cases. Finally, the study identifies immediate research needs as well as the ones in the long-term. 
In the EU-27 countries, the importance of social sustainability of digital transformation (SOSDIT) is heightened by the need to balance economic growth with social cohesion. By prioritizing SOSDIT, the EU can ensure that its citizens are not left behind in the digital transformation process and that technology serves the needs of all Europeans. Therefore, the current study aimed firstly to evaluate the SOSDIT of EU-27 countries and then to model its importance in reaching sustainable development goals (SDGs). The current study, using structural equation modeling, provided quantitative empirical evidence that digital transformation in Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are respectively most socially sustainable. It is also found that SOSDIT leads the countries to have a higher performance in reaching SDGs. Finally, the study provided evidence implying the inverse relationship between the Gini coefficient and reaching SDGs. In other words, the higher the Gini coefficient of a country, the lower its performance in reaching SDGs. The findings of this study contribute to the literature of sustainability and digitalization. It also provides empirical evidence regarding the SOSDIT level of EU-27 countries that can be a foundation for the development of policies to improve the sustainability of digital transformation. According to the findings, this study provides practical recommendations for countries to ensure that their digital transformation is sustainable and has a positive impact on society. 
Promoting sustainable transportation options is increasingly crucial in the pursuit of environmentally friendly and efficient campus mobility systems. Among these options, bike-sharing programs have garnered substantial attention for their capacity to mitigate traffic congestion, decrease carbon emissions, and enhance overall campus sustainability. However, improper selection of bike-sharing sites has led to the growing problems of unsustainable practices in campus, including the disorderly parking and indiscriminate placement of bike-sharing. To this end, this paper proposes a novel sustainable development-oriented campus bike-sharing site evaluation model integrating the improved Delphi and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation approaches. Fourteen evaluation metrics are firstly selected from four dimensions: the user features, implementation and usage characteristics of parking spots, environmental sustainability, and social sustainability, through the combination of expert experience and the improved Delphi method. Then, the analytic hierarchy process and the entropy weight method are employed to determine the weights of the evaluation indices, ensuring a robust and objective assessment framework. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is finally implemented to evaluate the quality of location selection. South Campus of Henan Polytechnic University is selected as a case study using the proposed evaluation system. This work contributes to the existing body of knowledge by presenting a comprehensive location selection evaluation system for campus bike-sharing, informed by the principles of sustainable development. 
Background: The literature offers various methods for capturing software architectural knowledge (AK), including views, viewpoints, and architecture decision records (ADRs). In parallel, sustainability has gained prominence in software engineering, especially concerning software architecture. Nevertheless, practical industry reviews on these subjects seem to be lacking. Aim: In this research we aim to understand the current practice in architecture knowledge, and to explore where sustainability can be applied to address sustainability in software architecture in the future. Method: We used a survey, which utilized a questionnaire containing 34 questions and collected responses from 45 architects working at a prominent bank in the Netherlands, aimed to evaluate the practical representation and communication of architectural knowledge and sustainability. Result: Our analysis yielded two primary discoveries and several intriguing detailed results regarding how AK is captured and conveyed to diverse stakeholders. Firstly, it seems crucial to develop a new architectural element that connects various architectural features and perspectives tailored for different stakeholders. Secondly, providing clear guidance, references, and goals is essential to motivate architects to adopt Sustainable Software Engineering practices. Conclusion: After analysing the data collected through this survey, we have concluded that: a) There are no established domain-specific AK methods/tools in the financial domain. Most practitioners use domain-generic tools. b) A new architectural element that links the various architectural features and viewpoints created for various stakeholders appears to be necessary. c) There is sufficient sustainability awareness and motivation among software architects. However, what they lack are clear guidance, references, and goals to practice sustainable software engineering.
