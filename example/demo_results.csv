Li-doped Beryllonitrene for Enhanced Carbon Dioxide Capture,"  In recent years, the scientific community has given more and more attention
to the issue of climate change and global warming, which is largely attributed
to the massive quantity of carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, the demand for a
carbon dioxide capture material is massive and continuously increasing. In this
study, we perform first-principle calculations based on density functional
theory to investigate the carbon dioxide capture ability of pristine and doped
beryllonitrene. Our results show that carbon dioxide had an adsorption energy
of -0.046 eV on pristine beryllonitrene, so it appears that beryllonitrene has
extremely weak carbon dioxide adsorption ability. Pristine beryllonitrene could
be effectively doped with Lithium atoms, and the resulting Li-doped
beryllonitrene had much stronger interactions with carbon dioxide than pristine
beryllonitrene. The adsorption energy for carbon dioxide on Li-doped
beryllonitrene was -0.408 eV. The adsorption of carbon dioxide on Li-doped
beryllonitrene greatly changed the charge density, projected density of states,
and band structure of the material, demonstrating that it was strongly
adsorbed. This suggests that Li-doping is a viable way to enhance the carbon
dioxide capture ability of beryllonitrene and makes it a possible candidate for
an effective CO$_2$ capture material.

H$_2$ and CO$_2$ Network Strategies for the European Energy System,"  Hydrogen and carbon dioxide transport can both play an essential role in
climate-neutral energy systems. Hydrogen networks help serve regions with high
energy demand, while excess emissions are transported away in carbon dioxide
networks. For the synthesis of carbonaceous fuels, it is less clear which input
should be transported: hydrogen to carbon point sources or carbon to low-cost
hydrogen. We explore both networks' potential synergies and competition in a
cost-optimal carbon-neutral European energy system. In direct comparison, a
hydrogen network is more cost-effective than a carbon network, since it serves
to transport hydrogen to demand and to point source of carbon for utilization.
However, in a hybrid scenario where both networks are present, the carbon
network effectively complements the hydrogen network, promoting carbon capture
from biomass and reducing reliance on direct air capture. Our analysis suggests
integrating hydrogen and carbon dioxide networks into European energy policy
for a robust, carbon-neutral or carbon-negative future energy system.

"Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Optimization of Battery-Grade Lithium
  Carbonate Production","  By 2035, the need for battery-grade lithium is expected to quadruple. About
half of this lithium is currently sourced from brines and must be converted
from a chloride into lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) through a process called
softening. Conventional softening methods using sodium or potassium salts
contribute to carbon emissions during reagent mining and battery manufacturing,
exacerbating global warming. This study introduces an alternative approach
using carbon dioxide (CO2(g)) as the carbonating reagent in the lithium
softening process, offering a carbon capture solution. We employed an active
learning-driven high-throughput method to rapidly capture CO2(g) and convert it
to lithium carbonate. The model was simplified by focusing on the elemental
concentrations of C, Li, and N for practical measurement and tracking, avoiding
the complexities of ion speciation equilibria. This approach led to an
optimized lithium carbonate process that capitalizes on CO2(g) capture and
improves the battery metal supply chain's carbon efficiency.

"Two-stage Planning for Electricity-Gas Coupled Integrated Energy System
  with CCUS Considering Carbon Tax and Price Uncertainty","  In this article, we propose two-stage planning models for Electricity-Gas
Coupled Integrated Energy System (EGC-IES), in which traditional thermal power
plants (TTPPs) are considered to be retrofitted into carbon capture power
plants (CCPPs), with power to gas (PtG) coupling CCPPs to gas system. The
sizing and siting of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS)/PtG
facilities, as well as the operation cost of TTPPs/CCPPs/gas sources/PtG, are
all considered in the proposed model, including penalty on carbon emissions and
revenue of CCUS. With changing policy on climate change and carbon emission
regulation, the uncertainties of carbon price and carbon tax are also analysed
and considered in the proposed planning model. The stochastic planning, and
robust planning methods are introduced to verify mutually through economic and
carbon indices. The proposed methods' effectiveness in reducing carbon
emissions, increasing profit of CCUS from EGC-IES are demonstrated through
various cases and discussions.

"Assessing the optimal contributions of renewables and carbon capture and
  storage toward carbon neutrality by 2050","  Building on the carbon reduction targets agreed in the Paris Agreements, many
nations have renewed their efforts toward achieving carbon neutrality by the
year 2050. In line with this ambitious goal, nations are seeking to understand
the appropriate combination of technologies which will enable the required
reductions in such a way that they are appealing to investors. Around the
globe, solar and wind power lead in terms of renewable energy deployment, while
carbon capture and storage (CCS) is scaling up toward making a significant
contribution to deep carbon cuts.
  Using Japan as a case study nation, this research proposes a linear
optimization modeling approach to identify the potential contributions of
renewables and CCS toward maximizing carbon reduction and identifying their
economic merits over time. Results identify that the combination of these three
technologies could enable a carbon dioxide emission reduction of between 55 and
67 percent in the energy sector by 2050 depending on resilience levels and CCS
deployment regimes. Further reductions are likely to emerge with increased
carbon pricing over time.

A Quantitative Investigation of CO2 Sequestration by Mineral Carbonation,"  Anthropogenic activities have led to a substantial increase in carbon dioxide
(CO2), a greenhouse gas (GHG), contributing to heightened concerns of global
warming. In the last decade alone CO2 emissions increased by 2.0 ppm/yr.
globally. In the year 2009, United States and China contributed up to 43.4% of
global CO2 emissions. CO2 capture and sequestration have been recognized as
promising solutions to mitigate CO2 emissions from fossil fuel based power
plants. Typical techniques for carbon capture include post-combustion capture,
pre-combustion capture and oxy-combustion capture, which are under active
research globally. Mineral carbonation has been investigated as a suitable
technique for long term storage of CO2. Sequestration is a highly energy
intensive process and the additional energy is typically supplied by the power
plant itself. This leads to a reduction in net amount of CO2 captured because
of extra CO2 emitted. This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the energy
consumption during sequestration process for a typical 1GW pulverized coal and
a 1GW natural gas based power plant. Furthermore, it has been established that
the present day sequestration methods and procedures are not viable to achieve
the goal of carbon sequestration.

"Decarbonizing the European energy system in the absence of Russian gas:
  Hydrogen uptake and carbon capture developments in the power, heat and
  industry sectors","  Hydrogen and carbon capture and storage are pivotal to decarbonize the
European energy system in a broad range of pathway scenarios. Yet, their timely
uptake in different sectors and distribution across countries are affected by
supply options of renewable and fossil energy sources. Here, we analyze the
decarbonization of the European energy system towards 2060, covering the power,
heat, and industry sectors, and the change in use of hydrogen and carbon
capture and storage in these sectors upon Europe's decoupling from Russian gas.
The results indicate that the use of gas is significantly reduced in the power
sector, instead being replaced by coal with carbon capture and storage, and
with a further expansion of renewable generators. Coal coupled with carbon
capture and storage is also used in the steel sector as an intermediary step
when Russian gas is neglected, before being fully decarbonized with hydrogen.
Hydrogen production mostly relies on natural gas with carbon capture and
storage until natural gas is scarce and costly at which time green hydrogen
production increases sharply. The disruption of Russian gas imports has
significant consequences on the decarbonization pathways for Europe, with local
energy sources and carbon capture and storage becoming even more important.

"Economic Viability of the Energy-Water-Hydrogen Nexus for Power System
  Decarbonization","  This paper aims to evaluate the economic viability of the
energy-water-hydrogen (EWH) nexus as a new solution for reducing carbon
emissions from power systems. The urgency around climate change emphasizes the
pressing need to mitigate carbon emissions, especially from the electricity
sector, which accounts for a significant portion of total emissions in the US.
In response, incorporating more renewable energy sources (RESs) and green
hydrogen, created through water electrolysis and RES, stands out as a crucial
strategy to combat climate challenges. We delve into various aspects of the EWH
nexus, including carbon emissions from different power plants, capturing these
emissions, and potential options for their reuse or storage. This paper
involves modeling different sections of the EWH nexus and conducting an
economic analysis across scenarios in power plants to determine optimal water
supply methods, suitable chemical products for carbon reuse, and an appropriate
carbon emission penalty to encourage emission reduction through the EWH nexus.
The results indicate that reusing captured carbon emissions emerges as the most
beneficial option across all power plant types. This finding underscores the
potential of carbon reuse as a pivotal strategy within the EWH nexus framework
for addressing carbon emissions.

Carbon-Neutralized Task Scheduling for Green Computing Networks,"  Climate change due to increasing carbon emissions by human activities has
been identified as one of the most critical threat to Earth. Carbon
neutralization, as a key approach to reverse climate change, has triggered the
development of new regulations to enforce the economic activities toward low
carbon solutions. Computing networks that enable users to process
computation-intensive tasks contribute huge amount of carbon emissions due to
rising energy consumption. To analyze the achievable reduction of carbon
emissions by a scheduling policy, we first propose a novel virtual queueing
network model that captures communication and computing procedures in networks.
To adapt to highly variable and unpredictable nature of renewable energy
utilized by computing networks (i.e., carbon intensity of grid varies by time
and location), we propose a novel carbon-intensity based scheduling policy that
dynamically schedules computation tasks over clouds via the drift-plus-penalty
methodology in Lyapunov optimization. Our numerical analysis using real-world
data shows that the proposed policy achieves 54% reduction on the cumulative
carbon emissions for AI model training tasks compared to the queue-length based
policy.

"Joint Trading and Scheduling among Coupled Carbon-Electricity-Heat-Gas
  Industrial Clusters","  This paper presents a carbon-energy coupling management framework for an
industrial park, where the carbon flow model accompanying multi-energy flows is
adopted to track and suppress carbon emissions on the user side. To deal with
the quadratic constraint of gas flows, a bound tightening algorithm for
constraints relaxation is adopted. The synergies among the carbon capture,
energy storage, power-to-gas further consume renewable energy and reduce carbon
emissions. Aiming at carbon emissions disparities and supply-demand imbalances,
this paper proposes a carbon trading ladder reward and punishment mechanism and
an energy trading and scheduling method based on Lyapunov optimization and
matching game to maximize the long-term benefits of each industrial cluster
without knowing the prior information of random variables. Case studies show
that our proposed trading method can reduce overall costs and carbon emissions
while relieving energy pressure, which is important for Environmental, Social

"Carbon Leakage in a European Power System with Inhomogeneous Carbon
  Prices","  Global warming is one of the main threats to the future of humanity and
extensive emissions of greenhouse gases are found to be the main cause of
global temperature rise as well as climate change. During the last decades
international attention has focused on this issue, as well as on searching for
viable solutions to mitigate global warming. In this context, the pricing of
greenhouse gas emissions turned out to be the most prominent mechanism: First,
to lower the emissions, and second, to capture their external costs. By now,
various carbon dioxide taxes have been adopted by several countries in Europe
and around the world; moreover, the list of these countries is growing.
However, there is no standardized approach and the price for carbon varies
significantly from one country to another. Regionally diversified carbon prices
in turn lead to carbon leakage, which will offset the climate protection goals.
In this paper, a simplified European power system with flexible carbon prices
regarding the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is investigated. A distribution
parameter that quantifies carbon leakage is defined and varied together with
the base carbon price, where the combination of both parameters describes the
spatially resolved price distribution, i.e. the effective carbon pricing among
the European regions. It is shown that inhomogeneous carbon prices will indeed
lead to significant carbon leakage across the continent, and that coal-fired
electricity generation will remain a cheap and therefore major source of power
in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe - representing a potential risk for the
long term decarbonization targets within the European Union.

"Exploring Mechanisms of Hydration and Carbonation of MgO and Mg(OH)2 in
  Reactive Magnesium Oxide-based Cements","  Reactive magnesium oxide (MgO)-based cement (RMC) can play a key role in
carbon capture processes. However, knowledge on the driving forces that control
the degree of carbonation and hydration and rate of reactions in this system
remains limited. In this work, density functional theory-based simulations are
used to investigate the physical nature of the reactions taking place during
the fabrication of RMCs under ambient conditions. Parametric indicators such as
adsorption energies, charge transfer, electron localization function,
adsorption/dissociation energy barriers and the mechanisms of interaction of
H2O and CO2 molecules with MgO and brucite (Mg(OH)2) clusters are considered.
The following hydration and carbonation interactions relevant to RMCs are
evaluated i) carbonation of MgO, ii) hydration of MgO, carbonation of hydrated
MgO, iii) carbonation of Mg(OH)2, iv) hydration of Mg(OH)2 and v) hydration of
carbonated Mg(OH)2. A comparison of the energy barriers and reaction pathways
of these mechanisms shows that the carbonation of MgO is hindered by presence
of H2O molecules, while the carbonation of Mg(OH)2 is hindered by the formation
of initial carbonate and hydrate layers as well as presence of excessed H2O
molecules. To compare these finding to bulk mineral surfaces, the interactions
of the CO2 and H2O molecules with the MgO(001) and Mg(OH)2 (001) surfaces are
studied. Therefore, this work presents deep insights into the physical nature
of the reactions and the mechanisms involved in hydrated magnesium carbonates
production that can be beneficial for its development.

Machine Guided Discovery of Novel Carbon Capture Solvents,"  The increasing importance of carbon capture technologies for deployment in
remediating CO2 emissions, and thus the necessity to improve capture materials
to allow scalability and efficiency, faces the challenge of materials
development, which can require substantial costs and time. Machine learning
offers a promising method for reducing the time and resource burdens of
materials development through efficient correlation of structure-property
relationships to allow down-selection and focusing on promising candidates.
Towards demonstrating this, we have developed an end-to-end ""discovery cycle""
to select new aqueous amines compatible with the commercially viable acid gas
scrubbing carbon capture. We combine a simple, rapid laboratory assay for CO2
absorption with a machine learning based molecular fingerprinting model
approach. The prediction process shows 60% accuracy against experiment for both
material parameters and 80% for a single parameter on an external test set. The
discovery cycle determined several promising amines that were verified
experimentally, and which had not been applied to carbon capture previously. In
the process we have compiled a large, single-source data set for carbon capture
amines and produced an open source machine learning tool for the identification
of amine molecule candidates

the important roles of interfacial adhesion and diffusion that govern selective

Single molecule capturer by doped monatomic carbon chain,"  The B-doped monatomic carbon chain has fine molecular capture ability to H2O
and especially to NO2, better than other doped monatomic carbon chains.At 300 K
and 1 atm, the capture probability of the B-doped monatomic carbon chain is
appreciable even in a NO2 concentration of 1 p.p.m., and the adsorbates'
influence on the quantum transport is notable for the detection. In contrast,
the pure monatomic carbon chain shows its invulnerability to N2, O2, H2O, NO2,
CO and CO2, and it is incapable for molecule capturing due to too low
adsorption ability and weak response on the quantum conductance. In the
investigation of these issues, a statistic mechanical model [EPL 94, 40002

"A Two-Stage Online Algorithm for EV Charging Station Energy Management
  and Carbon Trading","  The increasing electric vehicle (EV) adoption challenges the energy
management of charging stations (CSs) due to the large number of EVs and the
underlying uncertainties. Moreover, the carbon footprint of CSs is growing
significantly due to the rising charging power demand. This makes it important
for CSs to properly manage their energy usage and ensure their carbon footprint
stay within their carbon emission quotas. This paper proposes a two-stage
online algorithm for this purpose, considering the different time scales of
energy management and carbon trading. In the first stage, the CS characterizes
the real-time aggregate EV power flexibility, in terms of upper and lower
bounds on the total charging power, by a Lyapunov optimization-based online
algorithm. In the second stage, the CS co-optimizes energy management and
carbon trading, with EV charging power chosen within the aggregate flexibility
region provided by the first stage. A generalized battery model is proposed to
capture the dynamic carbon footprint changes and carbon trading. A virtual
carbon queue is designed to develop an online algorithm for the second stage,
which can ensure the carbon footprint of CS be within its carbon emission quota

the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm.

"Integration of hydrothermal liquefaction and carbon capture and storage
  for the production of advanced liquid biofuels with negative CO2 emissions","  The technical and economic feasibility to deliver sustainable liquid biocrude
through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) while enabling negative carbon dioxide
emissions is evaluated in this paper, looking into the potential of the process
in the context of negative emission technologies (NETs) for climate change
mitigation. In the HTL process, a gas phase consisting mainly of carbon dioxide
is obtained as a side product driving a potential for the implementation of
carbon capture and storage in the process (BECCS) that has not been explored
yet in the existing literature and is undertaken in this study. To this end,
the process is divided in a standard HTL base and a carbon capture add-on,
having forestry residues as feedstock. The Selexol technology is adapted in a
novel scheme to simultaneously separate the CO2 from the HTL gas and recover
the excess hydrogen for biocrude upgrading. The cost evaluation indicates that
the additional cost of the carbon capture can be compensated by revenues from
the excess process heat and the European carbon allowance market. The impact in
the MFSP of the HTL base case ranges from -7% to 3%, with -15% in the most
favorable scenario, with a GHG emissions reduction potential of 102-113%
compared to the fossil baseline. These results show that the implementation of
CCS in the HTL process is a promising alternative from technical, economic and

Direct CO2 Electroreduction from Carbonate,"  The process of CO2 valorization, all the way from capture of CO2 to its
electrochemical upgrade, requires significant inputs in each of the capture,
upgrade, and separation steps. The gas phase CO2 feed following the
capture-and-release stage and into the CO2 electroreduction stage produce a
large waste of CO2, between 80 and 95% of CO2 is wasted due to carbonate
formation or electrolyte crossover, that adds cost and energy consumption to
the CO2 management aspect of the system. Here we report an electrolyzer that
instead directly upgrades carbonate electrolyte from CO2 capture solution to
syngas, achieving 100% carbon utilization across the system. A bipolar membrane
is used to produce proton in situ, under applied potential, which facilitates
CO2 releasing at the membrane:catalyst interface from the carbonate solution.
Using an Ag catalyst, we generate pure syngas at a 3 to 1 H2 to CO ratio, with
no CO2 dilution at the gas outlet, at a current density of 150 mA cm-2, and
achieve a full cell energy efficiency of 35%. The direct carbonate cell was
stable under a continuous 145 h of catalytic operation at ca. 180 mA cm-2. The
work demonstrates that coupling CO2 electrolysis directly with a CO2 capture

"A Genetic Algorithm Trained Machine-Learned Interatomic Potential for

"Synthetic methane for closing the carbon loop: Comparative study of
  three carbon sources for remote carbon-neutral fuel synthetization","  Achieving carbon neutrality is probably one of the most important challenges
of the 21st century for our societies. Part of the solution to this challenge
is to leverage renewable energies. However, these energy sources are often
located far away from places that need the energy, and their availability is
intermittent, which makes them challenging to work with. In this paper, we
build upon the concept of Remote Renewable Energy Hubs (RREHs), which are hubs
located at remote places with abundant renewable energy sources whose purpose
is to produce carbon-neutral synthetic fuels. More precisely, we model and
study the Energy Supply Chain (ESC) that would be required to provide a
constant source of carbon-neutral synthetic methane, also called e-NG (electric
Natural Gas) or e-methane (electric methane), in Belgium from an RREH located
in Morocco. To be carbon neutral, a synthetic fuel has to be produced from
existing carbon dioxide (CO2) that needs to be captured using either Direct Air
Capture (DAC) or Post Combustion Carbon Capture (PCCC). In this work, we detail
the impact of three different carbon sourcing configurations on the price of
the e-methane delivered in Belgium. Our results show that sourcing CO2 through
a combination of DAC and PCCC is more cost-effective, resulting in a cost of
146 e/MWh for e-methane delivered in Belgium, as opposed to relying solely on

"A Data-Driven Approach for Discovering the Most Probable Transition
  Pathway for a Stochastic Carbon Cycle System","  Many natural systems exhibit tipping points where changing environmental
conditions spark a sudden shift to a new and sometimes quite different state.
Global climate change is often associated with the stability of marine carbon
stocks. We consider a stochastic carbonate system of the upper ocean to capture
such transition phenomena. Based on the Onsager-Machlup action functional
theory, we calculate the most probable transition pathway between the
metastable and oscillatory states via a neural shooting method, and further
explore the effects of external random carbon input rates on the most probable
transition pathway, which provides a basis to recognize naturally occurring
tipping points. Particularly, we investigate the effect of the transition time
on the transition pathway and further compute the optimal transition time using
physics informed neural network, towards the maximum carbonate concentration
state in the oscillatory regimes. This work offers some insights on the effects
of random carbon input on climate transition in a simple model. Key words:

shooting method, stochastic carbon cycle system.

"Abundances of neutron-capture elements in CH and Carbon-Enhanced
  Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars","  All the elements heavier than Fe are produced either by slow (-s) or rapid
(-r) neutron-capture process. Neutron density prevailing in the stellar sites
is one of the major factors that determines the type of neutron-capture
processes. We present the results based on the estimates of corrected value of
absolute carbon abundance, [C/N] ratio, carbon isotopic ratio and [hs/ls] ratio
obtained from the high resolution spectral analysis of six stars that include
both CH stars and CEMP stars. All the stars show enhancement of neutron-capture
elements. Location of these objects in the A(C) vs. [Fe/H] diagram shows that
they are Group I objects, with external origin of carbon and neutron-capture
elements. Low values of carbon isotopic ratios estimated for these objects may
also be attributed to some external sources. As the carbon isotopic ratio is a
good indicator of mixing, we have used the estimates of 12C/13C ratios to
examine the occurance of mixing in the stars. While the object HD 30443 might
have experienced an extra mixing process that usually occurs after red giant
branch (RGB) bump for stars with log(L/L0) > 2.0, the remaining objects do not
show any evidence of having undergone any such mixing process. The higher
values of [C/N] ratios obtained for these objects also indicate that none of
these objects have experienced any strong internal mixing processes. Based on
the estimated abundances of carbon and the neutron-capture elements, and the
abundance ratios, we have classified the objects into different groups. While
the objects HE 0110-0406, HD 30443 and CD-38 2151 are found to be CEMP-s stars,
HE 0308-1612 and HD 176021 show characteristic properties of CH stars with
moderate enhancement of carbon. The object CD-28 1082 with enhancement of both
r- and s-process elements is found to belong to the CEMP-r/s group.

"Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Star Frequencies in the Galaxy: Corrections
  for the Effect of Evolutionary Status on Carbon Abundances","  We revisit the observed frequencies of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP)
stars as a function of the metallicity in the Galaxy, using data from the
literature with available high-resolution spectroscopy. Our analysis excludes
stars exhibiting clear over-abundances of neutron-capture elements, and takes
into account the expected depletion of surface carbon abundance that occurs due
to CN processing on the upper red-giant branch. This allows for the recovery of
the initial carbon abundance of these stars, and thus for an accurate
assessment of the frequencies of carbon-enhanced stars. The correction
procedure we develope is based on stellar-evolution models, and depends on the
surface gravity, log g, of a given star. Our analysis indicates that, for stars
with [Fe/H]<=-2.0, 20% exhibit [C/Fe]>=+0.7. This fraction increases to 43% for
[Fe/H]<=-3.0 and 81% for [Fe/H]<=-4.0, which is higher than have been
previously inferred without taking the carbon-abundance correction into
account. These CEMP-star frequencies provide important inputs for Galactic and
stellar chemical-evolution models, as they constrain the evolution of carbon at
early times and the possible formation channels for the CEMP-no stars. We also
have developed a public online tool with which carbon corrections using our
procedure can be easily obtained.

"Towards CO2 valorization in a multi remote renewable energy hub
  framework","  In this paper, we propose a multi-RREH (Remote Renewable Energy Hub) based
optimization framework. This framework allows a valorization of CO2 using
carbon capture technologies. This valorization is grounded on the idea that CO2
gathered from the atmosphere or post combustion can be combined with hydrogen
to produce synthetic methane. The hydrogen is obtained from water electrolysis
using renewable energy (RE). Such renewable energy is generated in RREHs, which
are locations where RE is cheap and abundant (e.g., solar PV in the Sahara
Desert, or wind in Greenland). We instantiate our framework on a case study
focusing on Belgium and 2 RREHs, and we conduct a techno-economic analysis.
This analysis highlights the key role played by the cost of the two main carbon
capture technologies: Post Combustion Carbon Capture (PCCC) and Direct Air
Capture (DAC). In addition, we use our framework to derive a carbon price
threshold above which carbon capture technologies may start playing a pivotal
role in the decarbonation process of our industries. For example, this price
threshold may give relevant information for calibrating the EU Emission Trading
System so as to trigger the emergence of the multi-RREH.

that the thiocyanate anion plays a key role in gas capture, whereas the impact

"Initial stage of growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes : modelling
  and simulations","  Through a careful modeling of interactions, collisions, and the catalytic
behavior, one can obtain important information about the initial stage of
growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), where a state-of-the-art
semi-empirical Hamiltonian [Phys. Rev. B, 74, 155408 (2006)] is used to model
the interaction between carbon atoms. The metal catalyst forming a
supersaturated metal-alloy droplet is represented by a jellium, and the effect
of collisions between the carbon atoms and the catalyst is captured by charge
transfers between the jellium and the carbon. Starting from carbon clusters in
different initial configurations (e.g., random structures, cage structures,
bulk-cut spherical clusters, etc.), we anneal them to different temperatures.
These simulations are performed with clusters placed in the jellium as well as
in vacuum. We find that, in the presence of jellium, and for an optimal charge
transfer of ~ 0.1 e-0.2 e, open cage structures (and some elongated cage
structures) are formed, which may be viewed as precursors to the growth of
SWCNTs. We will also discuss the implications of a spherical boundary on the
nucleation of a SWCNT.

"Machine Learning-based Estimation of Forest Carbon Stocks to increase
  Transparency of Forest Preservation Efforts","  An increasing amount of companies and cities plan to become CO2-neutral,
which requires them to invest in renewable energies and carbon emission
offsetting solutions. One of the cheapest carbon offsetting solutions is
preventing deforestation in developing nations, a major contributor in global
greenhouse gas emissions. However, forest preservation projects historically
display an issue of trust and transparency, which drives companies to invest in
transparent, but expensive air carbon capture facilities. Preservation projects
could conduct accurate forest inventories (tree diameter, species, height etc.)
to transparently estimate the biomass and amount of stored carbon. However,
current rainforest inventories are too inaccurate, because they are often based
on a few expensive ground-based samples and/or low-resolution satellite
imagery. LiDAR-based solutions, used in US forests, are accurate, but
cost-prohibitive, and hardly-accessible in the Amazon rainforest. We propose
accurate and cheap forest inventory analyses through Deep Learning-based
processing of drone imagery. The more transparent estimation of stored carbon
will create higher transparency towards clients and thereby increase trust and
investment into forest preservation projects.

"Sustainable financing of permanent CO2 disposal through a Carbon
  Takeback Obligation","  Unless there is immediate, unprecedented, reduction in global demand for
carbon-intensive energy and products, then capture and permanent storage of
billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually will be needed before
mid-century to meet Paris Agreement goals. Yet competition from cheaper,
temporary, carbon storage means that permanent disposal remains starved of
investment, currently representing about 0.1% of Energy and Industrial Process
(EIP) emissions. This stored fraction must reach 100% to stop EIPs causing
global warming. Here we show that a cost-effective transition can occur by
mandating an increasing stored fraction through a progressive Carbon Takeback
Obligation (CTO) on fossil fuel producers and importers. Projected costs of
storage to the consumer are lower than pricing carbon emissions in conventional
1.5{\deg}C scenarios until the 2040s, and comparable or lower thereafter. A CTO
combined with measures to reduce CO2 production would deliver the lowest-risk
pathway to achieving net zero.

"Integrated Assessment Modeling of Korea 2050 Carbon Neutrality
  Technology Pathways","  This integrated assessment modeling research analyzes what Korea's 2050
carbon neutrality would require for the national energy system and the role of
the power sector concerning the availability of critical mitigation
technologies. Our scenario-based assessments show that Korea's current policy
falls short of what the nation's carbon-neutrality ambition would require.
Across all technology scenarios examined in this study, extensive and rapid
energy system transition is imperative, requiring the large-scale deployment of
renewables and carbon capture & storage (CCS) early on and negative emission
technologies (NETs) by the mid-century. Importantly, rapid decarbonization of
the power sector that goes with rapid electrification of end-uses seems to be a
robust national decarbonization strategy. Furthermore, we contextualize our
net-zero scenario results using policy costs, requirements for natural
resources, and the expansion rate of zero-carbon technologies. We find that the
availability of nuclear power lowers the required expansion rate of renewables
and CCS, alleviating any stress on terrestrial and geological systems. By
contrast, the limited availability of CCS without nuclear power necessarily
demands a very high penetration of renewables and significantly high policy
compliance costs, which would decrease the feasibility of achieving the carbon
neutrality target.

"Experimental study and reaction path modeling of the carbonation of
  natural serpentinites","  Mineralization of carbon dioxide is often seen as an attractive alternative
to classical Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, allowing the
sequestration of \ce{CO2} as a solid mineral with no risk of aquifer
contamination or leakage back to the atmosphere. While olivine and pyroxenes
are known to easily and quickly react with dissolved \ce{CO2}, fresh
peridotites are quite rare and ultramafic rocks usually contain significant
amounts of serpentine, which presents a lower reactivity. The purpose of this
study was then to analyze the reactivity of two natural rocks: a partially
serpentinized lherzolite and a fully altered serpentinite. Results confirm that
serpentine is much slower to react and gets altered only if the activity of
\ce{CO2} is high enough and if all olivine and pyroxenes have already been

Cathodic Carbon Chemically Adsorbs Carbon Dioxide: Why Is it True?,"  Large-scale applications are waiting for an optimal CO2 scavenger to
reinforce CCS and CCU technologies. We herein introduce and succinctly validate
a new philosophy of capturing gaseous CO2 by negatively-charged carbonaceous
structures. The chemical absorption of CO2 turns out possible thanks to the
emergence of significant nucleophilic interaction carbon centers upon applying
voltage. The carbonaceous cathode, therefore, may serve as a prototype of a new
CO2 sorbent. As a model to simulate chemisorption, we used a small-sized
graphene quantum dot (GQD). According to the recorded reaction profiles, the
negatively charged GQD containing 16 carbon atoms readily reacts with the CO2
molecule and produces carboxylated GQD. In turn, the activation energy (60
kJ/mol) and energy effect (-55 kJ/mol) for the reaction in water appeared
surprisingly competitive in the context of the literature. We hypothesize that
the carbonaceous cathode deserves in-depth experimental research as a possible
CO2 chemical sorbent. Despite we used GQD for simulations, the encouraging
results can be extrapolated to other nanoscale carbons and, more importantly,
to the activated carbon species widely employed in modern electrochemical
devices.

Implementing defenses in ML systems often necessitates additional computational

robustness to higher emissions. Addressing the critical need to quantify this

demonstrate the RCTI through an experiment involving evasion attacks, analyzing

energy of the carbonate ion hydrolysis with the decrease of the number of water
molecules in confined nano-pores. The influences of pore size, spacing of
cations, surface hydrophobicity and temperature on CO2 capture efficiency are
elucidated. The study may help to design an efficient direct air capture system

Combined Oxy-fuel Magnetohydrodynamic Power Cycle,"  Oxy-fuel carbon capture in power plants is a relatively new concept aiming at
reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the plants. This is achieved by burning
the fossil fuel using oxygen as oxidizer with no nitrogen, thereby rendering
the exhaust gases very rich in carbon dioxide (after condensing water vapor by
cooling), which facilitates its capture for environmental or commercial
purposes. Despite the worldwide interest in oxy-fuel carbon capture, its
progress is at risk given the large energy needed to separate oxygen from air
in order to provide the oxidizer, thereby hindering further progress of this
concept toward large-scale applications. This paper focuses on alleviating this
drawback of oxy-fuel combustion by making it more attractive through combining
it with another concept, namely magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generators. The
end product is a power plant operating on a combined cycle composed of a
topping MHD ultra-high-temperature cycle with direct electricity extraction
from plasma, followed by a bottoming steam cycle with conventional
turbo-generators. Different design aspects and simplified technical analysis
for the MHD generator are presented.

carbon concentration when \ch{CO2} diffuses and flows in water. The technique
employs three different pH indicators, which, when combined with an image

to usual techniques in which a single pH indicator is used, the methodology
presented allows not only to produce a binary classification (pH larger or

the method against benchmark solutions and further demonstrate its potential by
measuring the pH and total carbon concentration in a density driven convection

"Propagation of a carbon price in a credit portfolio through
  macroeconomic factors","  We study how the climate transition through a low-carbon economy, implemented
by carbon pricing, propagates in a credit portfolio and precisely describe how
carbon price dynamics affects credit risk measures such as probability of
default, expected and unexpected losses. We adapt a stochastic multisectoral
model to take into account the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions costs of both
sectoral firms' production and consumption, as well as sectoral household's
consumption. GHG emissions costs are the product of carbon prices, provided by
the NGFS transition scenarios, and of GHG emissions. For each sector, our model
yields the sensitivity of firms' production and households' consumption to
carbon price and the relationships between sectors. It allows us to analyze the
short-term effects of the carbon price as opposed to standard IAM (such as
REMIND), which are deterministic and only capture long-term trends. Finally, we
use a DCF methodology to compute firms' values which we then combine with a
structural credit risk model to describe how the carbon price impacts credit
risk measures. We obtain that the carbon price distorts the distribution of the
firm's value, increases banking fees charged to clients (materialized by the
bank provisions), and reduces banks' profitability (translated by the economic
capital). In addition, the randomness we introduce provides extra flexibility
to take into account uncertainties on the productivity and on the different
transition scenarios. We also compute the sensitivities of the credit risk
measures with respect to changes in the carbon price, yielding further criteria
for a more accurate assessment of climate transition risk in a credit
portfolio. This work provides a preliminary methodology to calculate the
evolution of credit risk measures of a credit portfolio, starting from a given
climate transition scenario described by a carbon price.

"The Development of a Chemical Kinetic Mechanism for Combustion in
  Supercritical Carbon Dioxide","  Direct fired supercritical CO2 (sCO2) power cycles allow for the combustion
of gaseous fuels under oxyfuel conditions with inherent carbon capture. As the
CO2 is captured intrinsically, the efficiency penalty of capture on the overall
plant is small, meaning that power plants achieve a similar efficiency to
traditional fossil fuel power plants without carbon capture and storage.
However, at high pressures and in large dilutions of CO2, combustion mechanisms
are poorly understood. Therefore, in this paper sensitivity and quantitative
analysis of four established chemical kinetic mechanisms have been employed to
determine the most important reactions and the best performing mechanisms over
a range of different conditions. CH3O2 chemistry was identified as a pivotal
mechanism component for modelling methane combustion above 200 atm. The
University of Sheffield (UoS) sCO2 mechanism created in the present work better
models the ignition delay time (IDT) of high-pressure combustion in a large
dilution of CO2. Quantitative analysis showed that the UoS sCO2 mechanism was
the best fit to the greatest number of IDT datasets and had the lowest average
absolute error value, thus indicating a superior performance compared to the
four existing chemical kinetic mechanisms, well-validated for lower pressure
conditions.

"Residual Carbon in Oxygen-Neon White Dwarfs and its Implications for
  Accretion-Induced Collapse","  We explore the effects of the residual $\mathrm{^{12}C}$ present in
oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONe WDs) on their evolution towards accretion-induced
collapse (AIC). We produce a set of ONe WD models using MESA and illustrate how
the amount and location of the residual carbon depends on the initial mass of
the star and assumptions about rotation and convective overshooting. We find a
wide range of possible $\mathrm{^{12}C}$ mass fractions roughly ranging from
0.1 to 10 per cent. Convection and thermohaline mixing that occurs as the ONe
WDs cool leads to nearly homogeneous interior compositions by the time that AIC
would occur. We evolve these ONe WD models and some toy WD models towards AIC
and find that regardless of the carbon fraction, the occurrence of Urca-process
cooling due to $\mathrm{^{23}Na}$ implies that the models are unlikely to reach
carbon ignition before electron captures on $\mathrm{^{24}Mg}$ occur.
Difficulties associated with modeling electron-capture-driven convective
regions in these ONe WDs prevent us from evolving our MESA models all the way
to thermonuclear oxygen ignition and the onset of collapse. Thus, firm
conclusions about the effect of carbon on the final fates of these objects
await improved modeling. However, it is clear that the inclusion of residual

"A Weakly Coordinating Anion Substantially Enhances Carbon Dioxide
  Fixation by Calcium and Barium Salts","  Carbon dioxide fixation and storage constitute a drastically important
problem for the humanity nowadays. We hereby publish a new solution based on
the alkaline earth salts with a weakly coordinating anion,
tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. The proposed solution was validated using a
robust combination of global minimum search and molecular dynamics simulations
utilizing a well-tested, reliable semiempirical Hamiltonian to monitor chemical
reactions. Calcium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate captures 5.5 CO2 molecules
per mole, whereas barium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate captures 3.6 CO2
molecules per mole. These capacities are much higher, as compared to the
established carbonate technology, which fixes only one CO2 molecule per one
metal atom. The conducted simulations reveal that electrostatic binding of CO2
to alkaline earth cations is more technologically interesting than formation of
carbonate salts. Our simulation results can be directly validated by sorption
measurements.

"Automated deep reinforcement learning for real-time scheduling strategy
  of multi-energy system integrated with post-carbon and direct-air carbon
  captured system","  The carbon-capturing process with the aid of CO2 removal technology (CDRT)
has been recognised as an alternative and a prominent approach to deep
decarbonisation. However, the main hindrance is the enormous energy demand and
the economic implication of CDRT if not effectively managed. Hence, a novel
deep reinforcement learning agent (DRL), integrated with an automated
hyperparameter selection feature, is proposed in this study for the real-time
scheduling of a multi-energy system coupled with CDRT. Post-carbon capture
systems (PCCS) and direct-air capture systems (DACS) are considered CDRT.
Various possible configurations are evaluated using real-time multi-energy data
of a district in Arizona and CDRT parameters from manufacturers' catalogues and
pilot project documentation. The simulation results validate that an optimised
soft-actor critic (SAC) algorithm outperformed the TD3 algorithm due to its
maximum entropy feature. We then trained four (4) SAC agents, equivalent to the
number of considered case studies, using optimised hyperparameter values and
deployed them in real time for evaluation. The results show that the proposed
DRL agent can meet the prosumers' multi-energy demand and schedule the CDRT
energy demand economically without specified constraints violation. Also, the
proposed DRL agent outperformed rule-based scheduling by 23.65%. However, the
configuration with PCCS and solid-sorbent DACS is considered the most suitable
configuration with a high CO2 captured-released ratio of 38.54, low CO2
released indicator value of 2.53, and a 36.5% reduction in CDR cost due to
waste heat utilisation and high absorption capacity of the selected sorbent.
However, the adoption of CDRT is not economically viable at the current carbon
price. Finally, we showed that CDRT would be attractive at a carbon price of
400-450USD/ton with the provision of tax incentives by the policymakers.

"Unveiling the hidden reaction kinetic network of carbon dioxide in
  supercritical aqueous solutions","  Dissolution of CO$_2$ in water followed by the subsequent hydrolysis
reactions is of great importance to the global carbon cycle, and carbon capture
and storage. Despite enormous previous studies, the reactions are still not
fully understood at the atomistic scale. Here, we combined ab initio molecular
dynamics simulations with Markov state models to elucidate the reaction
mechanisms and kinetics of CO$_2$ in supercritical water both in the bulk and
nanoconfined states. The integration of unsupervised learning with
first-principles data allows us to identify complex reaction coordinates and
pathways automatically instead of a priori human speculation. Interestingly,
our unbiased modelling found a novel pathway of dissolving CO$_2$(aq) under
graphene nanoconfinement, involving the pyrocarbonate anion
(C$_2$O$_5^{2-}$(aq)) as an intermediate state. The pyrocarbonate anion was
previously hypothesized to have a fleeting existence in water; however our
study reveals that it is a crucial reaction intermediate and stable carbon
species in the nanoconfined solutions. We even observed the formation of
pyrocarbonic acid (H$_2$C$_2$O$_5$(aq)), which was unknown in water. The
unexpected appearance of pyrocarbonates is related to the superionic behavior
of the confined solutions. We also found that carbonation reactions involve
collective proton transfer along transient water wires, which exhibits
concerted behavior in the bulk solution but proceeds stepwise under
nanoconfinement. Our study highlights the importance of large oxocarbons in
aqueous carbon reactions, with great implications for the deep carbon cycle and
the sequestration of CO$_2$.

Machine-learning based interatomic potential for amorphous carbon,"  We introduce a Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for atomistic
simulations of liquid and amorphous elemental carbon. Based on a
machine-learning representation of the density-functional theory (DFT)
potential-energy surface, such interatomic potentials enable materials
simulations with close-to DFT accuracy but at much lower computational cost. We
first determine the maximum accuracy that any finite-range potential can
achieve in carbon structures; then, using a novel hierarchical set of two-,
three-, and many-body structural descriptors, we construct a GAP model that can
indeed reach the target accuracy. The potential yields accurate energetic and
structural properties over a wide range of densities; it also correctly
captures the structure of the liquid phases, at variance with state-of-the-art
empirical potentials. Exemplary applications of the GAP model to surfaces of
""diamond-like"" tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) are presented, including an
estimate of the amorphous material's surface energy, and simulations of
high-temperature surface reconstructions (""graphitization""). The new
interatomic potential appears to be promising for realistic and accurate
simulations of nanoscale amorphous carbon structures.

"Modeling low saline carbonated water flooding including surface
  complexes","  Carbonated water flooding (CWI) increases oil production due to favorable
dissolution effects and viscosity reduction. Accurate modeling of CWI
performance requires a simulator with the ability to capture the true physics
of such process. In this study, compositional modeling coupled with surface
complexation modeling (SCM) are done, allowing a unified study of the influence
in oil recovery of reduction of salt concentration in water. The compositional
model consists of the conservation equations of total carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
chloride and decane. The coefficients of such equations are obtained from the
equilibrium partition of chemical species that are soluble both in oleic and
the aqueous phases. SCM is done by using the PHREEQC program, which determines
concentration of the master species. Estimation of the wettability as a
function of the Total Bound Product (TBP) that takes into account the
concentration of the complexes in the aqueous, oleic phases and in the rock

Skeletal Density Measurements for Adsorbent Nanomaterials,"  Due to their tunable material properties, sorptive materials have a wide
range of applications in energy storage, water treatment, carbon capture,
analytical chemistry, and more. One crucial factor in determining the
effectiveness of such materials is their skeletal density, or ""true density""
because it is often used to calculate key metrics, such as storage capacities.
In this paper, we present skeletal density measurements through helium
pycnometry for several types of adsorbent carbon materials derived from either
corncob, sawdust, coffee grounds, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), graphitic
carbon nitride (GCN), or metal organic frameworks (MOFs). The measured skeletal
density of sawdust-based activated carbon was 2.02 +/- 0.05 g/$cm^{ 3}$. The
measured skeletal density of coffee-based activated carbon was 2.23 +/- 0.06
$cm^{ 3}$. We also expound upon the impact that skeletal density has upon
hydrogen excess adsorption measurements and other calculated engineering
quantities. If a skeletal density is underestimated by 10%, it can affect the
room temperature excess adsorption by at least 5% at 100 bar and by 7% at 200
bar, depending on the material type.

Alkalinity Concentration Swing for Direct Air Capture of Carbon Dioxide,"  We describe a new principle - the Alkalinity Concentration Swing (ACS) - for
direct air capture of carbon dioxide driven by concentrating an alkaline
solution that has been exposed to the atmosphere and loaded with dissolved
inorganic carbon. Upon concentration, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide
increases, allowing for extraction and compression. We find that higher
concentration factors result in proportionally higher outgassing pressure, and
higher initial alkalinity concentrations at the same concentration factor
outgas a higher concentration of CO2 relative to the feed solution. We examine
two desalination technologies, reverse osmosis and capacitive deionization, as
possible implementation for the ACS, and evaluate two simplified corresponding
energy models. We compare the ACS to incumbent technologies and make estimates
on water, land, and energy requirements for capturing one million tonnes of CO2
per year. We find that estimates for the lower end of the energy range for both
reverse osmosis and capacitive deionization approaches are lower than or
roughly equal to incumbent direct air capture approaches. For most conditions,
we find an inverse relationship between the required energy and water
processing volume per million tonnes of CO2. Realizing the ACS requires a
simple alkaline aqueous solvent (e.g. potassium alkalinity carrier) and does
not require heat as a driving mechanism. More generally, the ACS can be
implemented through industrial-scale desalination approaches, meaning current
technology could be leveraged for scale-up.

"CarbNN: A Novel Active Transfer Learning Neural Network To Build De Novo
  Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for Carbon Capture","  Over the past decade, climate change has become an increasing problem with
one of the major contributing factors being carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions;
almost 51% of total US carbon emissions are from factories. Current materials
used in CO2 capture are lacking either in efficiency, sustainability, or cost.
  Electrocatalysis of CO2 is a new approach where CO2 can be reduced and the
components used industrially as fuel, saving transportation costs, creating
financial incentives. Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are crystals made of
organo-metals that adsorb, filter, and electrocatalyze CO2. The current
available MOFs for capture & electrocatalysis are expensive to manufacture and
inefficient at capture. The goal therefore is to computationally design a MOF
that can adsorb CO2 and catalyze carbon monoxide & oxygen with low cost.
  A novel active transfer learning neural network was developed, utilizing
transfer learning due to limited available data on 15 MOFs. Using the Cambridge
Structural Database with 10,000 MOFs, the model used incremental mutations to
fit a trained fitness hyper-heuristic function. Eventually, a Selenium MOF
(C18MgO25Se11Sn20Zn5) was converged on. Through analysis of predictions &
literature, the converged MOF was shown to be more effective & more
synthetically accessible than existing MOFs, showing the model had an
understanding of effective electrocatalytic structures in the material space.
This novel network can be implemented for other gas separations and catalysis
applications that have limited training accessible datasets.

"Investigating climate tipping points under various emission reduction
  and carbon capture scenarios with a stochastic climate model","  We study the mitigation of climate tipping point transitions using an energy
balance model. The evolution of the global mean surface temperature is coupled
with the CO2 concentration through the green house effect. We model the CO2
concentration with a stochastic delay differential equation (SDDE), accounting
for various carbon emission and capture scenarios. The resulting coupled system
of SDDEs exhibits a tipping point phenomena: if CO2 concentration exceeds a
critical threshold (around 478ppm), the temperature experiences an abrupt
increase of about six degrees Celsius. We show that the CO2 concentration
exhibits a transient growth which may cause a climate tipping point, even if
the concentration decays asymptotically. We derive a rigorous upper bound for
the CO2 evolution which quantifies its transient and asymptotic growths, and
provides sufficient conditions for evading the climate tipping point. Combining
this upper bound with Monte Carlo simulations of the stochastic climate model,
we investigate the emission reduction and carbon capture scenarios that would
avert the tipping point.

Chemical Diversity in the Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy Tucana II,"  We present the first detailed chemical abundance study of the ultra-faint
dwarf galaxy Tucana II based on high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra of four
red giant stars. The metallicity of these stars ranges from [Fe/H] = -3.2 to
-2.6, and all stars are low in neutron-capture abundances ([Sr/Fe] and [Ba/Fe]
< -1). However, a number of anomalous chemical signatures are present. Three
stars are carbon-enhanced, including the most metal-rich star. This star
([Fe/H]=-2.6) shows [Na,$\alpha$,Sc/Fe] < 0, suggesting an extended star
formation history with contributions from AGB stars and Type Ia supernovae. The
other carbon-enhanced stars have [Fe/H] < -3 and may be consistent with
enrichment by faint supernovae, if such supernovae can produce neutron-capture
elements. A fourth star with [Fe/H] = -3 is carbon-normal, and exhibits
distinct light element abundance ratios from the carbon-enhanced stars. The
carbon-normal star implies that at least two distinct nucleosynthesis sources,
both possibly associated with Population III stars, contributed to the early
chemical enrichment of this galaxy. Despite its very low luminosity, Tucana II
shows a diversity of chemical signatures that preclude it from being a simple

"STEP: Efficient Carbon Capture and Solar Thermal Electrochemical
  Production of ammonia, fuels, cement, carbon nanotubes, metals and bleach","  STEP (Solar Thermal Electrochemical Production) is an alternative solar
energy conversion process. New and original, unpublished STEP results are
compared with other STEP results. The STEP process uses semiconductors, solar
energy and electrochemistry to generate a wide range of useful chemicals,

and super bandgap (to generate electrons) insolation, STEP is more efficient
than either photovoltaic or photoelectochemical solar energy conversion. STEP
theory is derived and experimentally verified for the electrosynthesis of
energetic molecules at high solar energy efficiency. In STEP the efficient
formation of metals, fuels, chlorine, and carbon capture is driven by solar
thermal heated electrolyses occuring at voltage below that of the room
temperature energy stored in the products. As one example, CO2 is reduced to
either fuels, or storable carbon, at solar efficiency over 50% due to a synergy
of efficient solar thermal absorption and electrochemical conversion at high
temperature and reactant concentration. CO2 is efficiently transformed to
carbon nanotubes (C2CNT) with or without solar energy. New results on CO2-free

Pressure-induced Superconductivity in CaC2,"  Carbon can exist as isolated dumbbell, one-dimensional (1D) chain, 2D plane,
and 3D network in carbon solids or carbon-based compounds, which attributes to
its rich chemical binding way, including sp-, sp2-, and sp3-hybridized bonds.
Sp2 hybridizing carbon always captures special attention due to its unique
physical and chemical property. Here, using evolutionary algorithm in
conjunction with ab initio method, we found that under compression, dumbbell
carbon in CaC2 can be polymerized firstly into one-dimensional chain and then
into ribbon and further into two dimensional graphite sheet at higher pressure.
The C2m structure transforms into an orthorhombic Cmcm phase at 0.5 GPa,
followed by another orthorhombic Immm phase, which is stabilized at wide
pressure range of 15.2-105.8 GPa and then forced into MgB2-type phase with wide
range stability up to at least 1 TPa. Strong electron-phonon coupling in cold
compressed CaC2 is found, in particular for Immm phase, which has the highest
lambda value (0.562-0.564) among them, leading to its high superconducting
critical temperature (7.9~9.8 K), wihich is comparable to 11.5K value of CaC6.
Our research results show that calcium can not only stabilize carbon sp2
hybridization at larger range of pressure but make them present superconducting
behavior, which would further ignite experimental and theoretical research
interests on Alkali-Earth metal carbides to uncover their peculiar physical
properties under extreme conditions.

Chemical Cartography. I. A Carbonicity Map of the Galactic Halo,"  We present the first map of carbonicity, [C/Fe], for the halo system of the
Milky Way, based on a sample of over 100,000 main-sequence turnoff stars with
available spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This map, which
explores distances up to 15 kpc from the Sun, reveals clear evidence for the
dual nature of the Galactic halo, based on the spatial distribution of stellar
carbonicity. The metallicity distribution functions of stars in the inner- and
outer-halo regions of the carbonicity map reproduce those previously argued to
arise from contributions of the inner- and outer-halo populations, with peaks
at [Fe/H] = -1.5 and -2.2, respectively. From consideration of the absolute
carbon abundances for our sample, A(C), we also confirm that the
carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the outer-halo region exhibit a
higher frequency of CEMP-no stars (those with no overabundances of heavy
neutron-capture elements) than of CEMP-s stars (those with strong
overabundances of elements associated with the s-process), whereas the stars in
the inner-halo region exhibit a higher frequency of CEMP-s stars. We argue that
the contrast in the behavior of the CEMP-no and CEMP-s fractions in these
regions arises from differences in the mass distributions of the mini-halos
from which the stars of the inner- and outer-halo populations formed, which
gives rise in turn to the observed dichotomy of the Galactic halo.

Formation of Multiple Populations of M5 (NGC 5904),"  With our new Ca-CN-CH-NH photometry, we revisit the globular cluster (GC) M5.
We find that M5 is a mono-metallic GC with a small metallicity dispersion. Our
carbon abundances show that the $\sigma$[C/Fe] of the M5 CN-s population, with
depleted carbon and enhanced nitrogen abundances, is significantly large for a
single stellar population. Our new analysis reveals that the M5 CN-s population
is well described by the two stellar populations: the CN-s$_{\rm I}$, being the
major CN-s component, with the intermediate carbon and nitrogen abundance and
the CN-s$_{\rm E}$ with the most carbon-poor and nitrogen-rich abundance. We
find that the CN-s$_{\rm E}$ is significantly more centrally concentrated than
the others, while CN-w and CN-s$_{\rm I}$ have similar cumulative radial
distributions. The red giant branch bump $V$ magnitude, the helium abundance
barometer in mono-metallic populations, of individual populations appears to be
correlated with their mean carbon abundance, indicating that carbon abundances
are anticorrelated with helium abundances. We propose that the CN-s$_{\rm E}$
formed out of gas that experienced proton-capture processes at high
temperatures in the innermost region of the proto-GC of M5 that resided in a
dense ambient density environment. Shortly after, the CN-s$_{\rm I}$ formed out
of gas diluted from the pristine gas in the more spatially extended region,
consistent with the current development of numerical simulations by others.

"Molecular dynamics predictions of transport properties for carbon
  dioxide hydrates under pre-nucleation conditions using TIP4P/Ice water and
  EPM2, TraPPE, and Zhang carbon dioxide potentials","  (1) Introduction: New technologies that leverage gas hydrates phenomena
include carbon capture and sequestrations. These processes are often
semi-continuous and require regulation of the system's flow properties for
proper operation. Accurate computational models for the viscosity of carbon
dioxide hydrate systems at pre-nucleation conditions can be important for
process design and control of such technologies. (2) Methods: This work
validates the viscosity predictions of molecular dynamics simulations using
previously measured experimental data. The TIP4P/Ice force field was used to
model water, while the EPM2, TraPPE, and Zhang force fields were used for
carbon dioxide. The Green-Kubo and Einstein formulations of viscosity and
diffusivity were used in this work. (3) Results: All force fields overpredicted
viscosity when compared to experimental data, but EPM2 resulted in lower
discrepancies. Additionally, EPM2 was determined to model molecular behavior
expected from the macroscopic trends in viscosity with respect to temperature
and pressure. (4) Conclusions: The EPM2 force field more accurately predicted
the viscosity of carbon dioxide hydrates systems at pre-nucleation conditions
relative to TraPPE and Zhang.

"What drives the European carbon market? Macroeconomic factors and

widely used policy measure to achieve the target of net-zero emissions by 2050.
This paper tackles the issue of producing point, direction-of-change, and
density forecasts for the monthly real price of carbon within the EU Emissions
Trading Scheme (EU ETS). We aim to uncover supply- and demand-side forces that
can contribute to improving the prediction accuracy of models at short- and
medium-term horizons. We show that a simple Bayesian Vector Autoregressive
(BVAR) model, augmented with either one or two factors capturing a set of
predictors affecting the price of carbon, provides substantial accuracy gains
over a wide set of benchmark forecasts, including survey expectations and
forecasts made available by data providers. We extend the study to verified
emissions and demonstrate that, in this case, adding stochastic volatility can
further improve the forecasting performance of a single-factor BVAR model. We
rely on emissions and price forecasts to build market monitoring tools that
track demand and price pressure in the EU ETS market. Our results are relevant

"Estimating On-road Transportation Carbon Emissions from Open Data of
  Road Network and Origin-destination Flow Data","  Accounting for over 20% of the total carbon emissions, the precise estimation
of on-road transportation carbon emissions is crucial for carbon emission
monitoring and efficient mitigation policy formulation. However, existing
estimation methods typically depend on hard-to-collect individual statistics of
vehicle miles traveled to calculate emissions, thereby suffering from high data
collection difficulty. To relieve this issue by utilizing the strong pattern
recognition of artificial intelligence, we incorporate two sources of open data
representative of the transportation demand and capacity factors, the
origin-destination (OD) flow data and the road network data, to build a
hierarchical heterogeneous graph learning method for on-road carbon emission
estimation (HENCE). Specifically, a hierarchical graph consisting of the road
network level, community level, and region level is constructed to model the
multi-scale road network-based connectivity and travel connection between
spatial areas. Heterogeneous graphs consisting of OD links and spatial links
are further built at both the community level and region level to capture the
intrinsic interactions between travel demand and road network accessibility.
Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate
HENCE's effectiveness and superiority with R-squared exceeding 0.75 and
outperforming baselines by 9.60% on average, validating its success in
pioneering the use of artificial intelligence to empower carbon emission

Interaction-driven giant orbital magnetic moments in carbon nanotubes,"  Carbon nanotubes continue to be model systems for studies of confinement and
interactions. This is particularly true in the case of so-called ""ultra-clean""
carbon nanotube devices offering the study of quantum dots with extremely low
disorder. The quality of such systems, however, has increasingly revealed
glaring discrepancies between experiment and theory. Here we address the
outstanding anomaly of exceptionally large orbital magnetic moments in carbon
nanotube quantum dots. We perform low temperature magneto-transport
measurements of the orbital magnetic moment and find it is up to seven times
larger than expected from the conventional semiclassical model. Moreover, the
magnitude of the magnetic moment monotonically drops with the addition of each
electron to the quantum dot directly contradicting the widely accepted shell
filling picture of single-particle levels. We carry out quasiparticle
calculations, both from first principles and within the effective-mass
approximation, and find the giant magnetic moments can only be captured by
considering a self-energy correction to the electronic band structure due to
electron-electron interactions.

"Capturing the oxidation of silicon carbide in rocky exoplanetary

stars with C/O ratios higher than 0.65 (cf. C/O$_{\mathrm{Sun}}$ = 0.54), in
addition to its observations in meteorites, interstellar medium and
protoplanetary disks. Consequently, the interiors of rocky exoplanets born from
carbon-enriched refractory material are often assumed to contain large amounts
of silicon carbide. Here we aim to investigate the stability of silicon carbide
in the interior of carbon-enriched rocky exoplanets and to derive the reaction
leading to its transformation. We performed a high-pressure high-temperature
experiment to investigate the reaction between a silicon carbide layer and a
layer representative of the bulk composition of a carbon-enriched rocky
exoplanet. We report the reaction leading to oxidation of silicon carbide
producing quartz, graphite, and molten iron silicide. Combined with previous
studies, we show that in order to stabilize silicon carbide, carbon saturation
is not sufficient, and a complete reduction of Fe$^{2+}$ to Fe$^{0}$ in a
planetary mantle is required, suggesting that future spectroscopic detection of
Fe$^{2+}$ or Fe$^{3+}$ on the surface of rocky exoplanets would imply the

Optimizing Carbon Storage Operations for Long-Term Safety,"  To combat global warming and mitigate the risks associated with climate
change, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has emerged as a crucial technology.
However, safely sequestering CO2 in geological formations for long-term storage
presents several challenges. In this study, we address these issues by modeling
the decision-making process for carbon storage operations as a partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We solve the POMDP using belief
state planning to optimize injector and monitoring well locations, with the
goal of maximizing stored CO2 while maintaining safety. Empirical results in
simulation demonstrate that our approach is effective in ensuring safe
long-term carbon storage operations. We showcase the flexibility of our
approach by introducing three different monitoring strategies and examining
their impact on decision quality. Additionally, we introduce a neural network
surrogate model for the POMDP decision-making process to handle the complex
dynamics of the multi-phase flow. We also investigate the effects of different
fidelity levels of the surrogate model on decision qualities.

"Multi-technology co-optimization approach for sustainable hydrogen and

element, serving as a carbon-free energy carrier and feedstock. As efforts to
decarbonize sectors such as heating and transportation intensify, understanding
and navigating through the dynamics of hydrogen demand expansion becomes
critical. Transitioning to hydrogen economy is complicated by varying regional
scales and types of hydrogen demand, with forecasts indicating a rise in
variable demand that calls for diverse production technologies. Currently,
steam methane reforming is prevalent, but its significant carbon emissions make
a shift to cleaner alternatives like blue and green hydrogen imperative. Each

"Is adding charcoal to soil a good method for CO2 sequestration? -
  Modeling a spatially homogeneous soil","  Carbon sequestration is the process of capture and long-term storage of
atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) with the aim to avoid dangerous climate
change. In this paper, we propose a simple mathematical model (a coupled system
of nonlinear ODEs) to capture some of the dynamical effects produced by adding
charcoal to fertile soils. The main goal is to understand to which extent
charcoal is able to lock up carbon in soils. Our results are preliminary in the
sense that we do not solve the CO2 sequestration problem. Instead, we do set up
a flexible modeling framework in which the interaction between charcoal and
soil can be tackled by means of mathematical tools.
  We show that our model is well-posed and has interesting large-time
behaviour. Depending on the reference parameter range (e.g. type of soil) and
chosen time scale, numerical simulations suggest that adding charcoal typically

"A high-resolution carbon balance in a temperate catchment: insights from
  the Schwabach River, Germany","  This study examines stable carbon isotope (d13C) and concentration dynamics
of DIC, DOC, and POC over an entire year, using a high resolution dataset. This
research was performed in the catchment of the Schwabach River, a small,
karstic headwater stream in Germany. The DIC data indicated the dominance of
mineral weathering as a DIC source, with a dilution effect during high flow
periods. A weakly negative relationship between discharge and d13CDIC indicates
an increase in plant-derived organic matter during floods, transported to river
waters via overland runoff and intermediate flow. DOC inputs were enhanced
during periods of high discharge, indicating a greater importance of overland
runoff as a DOC source. POC concentrations seem unaffected by discharge, but a
slight negative correlation between d13CPOC and discharge may be derived from
increased C4 plant material inputs. CO2 concentrations exceeded ambient
atmospheric values throughout the year, confirming that the river surface
waters are a net CO2 source. The total riverine carbon flux was dominated by
DIC (70%), followed by CO2 efflux (21%), DOC (7%), and POC (2%). While a
bi-monthly sampling scheme yielded a similar carbon flux estimate to that
utilizing the entire dataset, the use of a monthly sampling interval differed
by up to 19%. This discrepancy is due to the inability of a monthly sampling
scheme to capture sudden and large variations in river discharge and associated
dissolved/particulate carbon concentration changes, such as those observed
during flooding. Bi-monthly sampling may be the minimum timeframe required for
an acceptable degree of accuracy in carbon flux calculations. The application
of high sampling frequencies and comprehensive DIC, DOC, and POC studies in
future research would reduce uncertainties in riverine carbon budgets, and
clarify the role of small streams in the global carbon cycle.

"Inflation Reduction Act impacts on the economics of clean hydrogen and
  liquid fuels","  The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the United States provides unprecedented
incentives for deploying low-carbon hydrogen and liquid fuels, among other low
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions technologies. To better understand the
prospective competitiveness of low-carbon or negative-carbon hydrogen and
liquid fuels under the IRA in the early 2030s, we examine the impacts of IRA
provisions on costs of producing hydrogen and synthetic liquid fuel made from
natural gas, electricity, short-cycle biomass (agricultural residues), and
corn-ethanol. With IRA credits (45V or 45Q), but excluding incentives provided
by other national or state policies, hydrogen produced by electrolysis using
carbon-free electricity (green H2) and natural gas reforming with carbon
capture and storage (CCS) (blue H2) are cost-competitive with the
carbon-intensive benchmark gray H2 from steam methane reforming.
Biomass-derived H2 with or without CCS is not cost-completive under current IRA
provisions. However, if IRA allowed biomass gasification with CCS to claim a
45V credit for carbon-neutral H2 and a 45Q credit for negative biogenic-CO2
emissions, this pathway would be less costly than gray H2. The IRA credit for
clean fuels (45Z), currently stipulated to end in 2027, would need to be
extended, or similar policy support provided by other national or state
policies, for clean synthetic liquid fuel to be cost-competitive with
petroleum-derived liquid fuels. Levelized IRA subsidies per unit of CO2
mitigated for all hydrogen and synthetic liquid fuel production pathways,
except electricity-derived synthetic liquid fuel, range from 65 to 384 $/t CO2,

Latent Space Simulation for Carbon Capture Design Optimization,"  The CO2 capture efficiency in solvent-based carbon capture systems (CCSs)
critically depends on the gas-solvent interfacial area (IA), making
maximization of IA a foundational challenge in CCS design. While the IA
associated with a particular CCS design can be estimated via a computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, using CFD to derive the IAs associated with
numerous CCS designs is prohibitively costly. Fortunately, previous works such
as Deep Fluids (DF) (Kim et al., 2019) show that large simulation speedups are
achievable by replacing CFD simulators with neural network (NN) surrogates that
faithfully mimic the CFD simulation process. This raises the possibility of a
fast, accurate replacement for a CFD simulator and therefore efficient
approximation of the IAs required by CCS design optimization. Thus, here, we
build on the DF approach to develop surrogates that can successfully be applied
to our complex carbon-capture CFD simulations. Our optimized DF-style
surrogates produce large speedups (4000x) while obtaining IA relative errors as
low as 4% on unseen CCS configurations that lie within the range of training
configurations. This hints at the promise of NN surrogates for our CCS design
optimization problem. Nonetheless, DF has inherent limitations with respect to
CCS design (e.g., limited transferability of trained models to new CCS
packings). We conclude with ideas to address these challenges.

  process","  Low-carbon dispatchable power underpins a sustainable energy system,
providing load balancing complementing wide-scale deployment of intermittent
renewable power. In this new context, fossil fuel-fired power plants must be
coupled with a post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) process capable of highly
transient operation. To tackle design and operational challenges
simultaneously, we have developed a computational framework that integrates
process design with techno-economic assessment. The backbone of this is a
high-fidelity PCC mathematical model of a pressure-vacuum swing adsorption
process. We demonstrate that the cost-optimal design has limited process
flexibility, challenging reactiveness to disturbances, such as those in the
flue gas feed conditions. The results illustrate that flexibility can be
introduced by relaxing the CO$_2$ recovery constraint on the operation, albeit
at the expense of the capture efficiency of the process. We discover that
adsorption-based processes can accommodate for significant flexibility and
improved performance with respect to the operational constraints on CO$_2$
recovery and purity. The results herein demonstrate a trade-off between process
economics and process operability, which must be effectively rationalised to

orientation of the molecule during impact. The IAM-PCM leads to significantly
reduced capture cross sections relative to IAM-AR at low energies, since it
takes into account the overlap of effective atomic cross sectional areas. We
compare our results with available experimental and other theoretical data
focusing on water vapor (H2O), methane (CH4) and uracil (C4H4N2O2). For the
water molecule target we also provide results from a classical-trajectory Monte
Carlo approach that includes dynamical screening effects on projectile and
target. For small molecules dominated by a many-electron atom, such as carbon
in methane, or oxygen in water we find a saturation phenomenon for higher
projectile charges (Q = 3) and low energies, where the net capture cross
section for the molecule is dominated by the net cross section for the
many-electron atom, and the net capture cross section is not proportional to
the total number of valence electrons.

Halogenation of Imidazolium Ionic Liquids. Thermodynamics Perspective,"  Imidazolium cations are promising for anion exchange membranes, and
electrochemical applications and gas capture. They can be chemically modified
in many ways including halogenation. Halogenation possibilities of the
imidazole ring constitute a particular interest. This work investigates
fluorination and chlorination reactions of all symmetrically non-equivalent
sites of the imidazolium cation. Halogenation of all carbon atoms is
thermodynamically permitted. Out of these, the most favorable site is the first
methylene group of the alkyl chain. In turn, the least favorable site is carbon
of the imidazole ring. Temperature dependence of enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs
free energy at 1 bar is discussed. The reported results provide an important
guidance in functionalization of ionic liquids in search of task-specific
compounds.

"Theory of complex fluids in the warm-dense-matter regime, and
  application to an unusual phase-transitions in liquid carbon","  Data from recent laser-shock experiments, density-functional theory (DFT)
with molecular-dynamics (MD), and path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations
on carbon are compared with predictions from the neutral-pseudo-atom (NPA)+
hyper-netted-chain (HNC) approach for carbon, a complex liquid in the
warm-dense matter regime. The NPA results are in good agreement, not only with
high-density regimes that have been studies via PIMC, but even at low densities
and low temperatures where transient covalent bonding dominates ionic
correlations. Thus the `pre-peak' due to the C-C bond at $\sim$1.4-1.6 \AA$\,$
and other features found in the pair-distribution function from DFT+MD
simulations at 0.86 eV and 3.7 g/cm$^3$ etc., are recovered accurately in the

average-atom ion-sphere (IS) models. Evidence for an unusual liquid $\to$ vapor
and metal$\to$ semi-metal transition occurring simultaneously is presented.
Here a strongly correlated metallic-liquid with transient C-C bonds, i.e.,
carbon at density $\sim$ 1.0 g/cm$^3$ and mean ionization $Z=4$ transits
abruptly to a disordered mono-atomic vapour at 7 eV, with $Z\simeq$ 3. Other
cases where $Z$ drops abruptly are also noted. The nature of $Z$, its
discontinuities, and the role of exchange correlation, are reviewed. The
limitations of IS models in capturing the physics of transient covalent bonding

KP Cyg: an Unusual Metal-rich RR Lyr Type Star of Long Period,"  We present the results of a detailed spectroscopic study of the long period
($P=0.856$ days) RR Lyrae star, KP Cyg. We derived abundances of many chemical
elements including the light species, iron-group elements and elements of the
s-processes. Most RR Lyrae stars with periods longer than 0.7 days are
metal-deficient objects. Surprisingly, our results show that KP Cyg is very
metal rich ([Fe/H] $= +0.18\pm 0.23$). By comparison with a number of short
period ($P=1\sim 6$ days), metal-rich CWB stars, we suggest that KP Cyg may be
a very short period CWB star (BL Her star) rather than an RR Lyrae star. As
seen in some CWB stars, KP Cyg shows strong excesses of carbon and nitrogen in
its atmosphere. This indicates that the surface of KP Cyg has been polluted by
material that has undergone helium burning (to enhance carbon) and proton
capture (to transform carbon into nitrogen). We also note that UY CrB, whose
period is 0.929 days, also shows an enhancement of C and N, and that two carbon
cepheids of short period, V553 Cen and RT TrA, show similar excesses of carbon
and nitrogen.

"Direct MD simulation of liquid-solid phase equilibria for two-component
  plasmas","  We determine the liquid-solid phase diagram for carbon-oxygen and
oxygen-selenium plasma mixtures using two-phase MD simulations. We identified
liquid, solid, and interface regions using a bond angle metric. To study finite
size effects, we perform 27648 and 55296 ion simulations. To help monitor
non-equilibrium effects, we calculate diffusion constants $D_i$. For the
carbon-oxygen system we find that $D_O$ for oxygen ions in the solid is much
smaller than $D_C$ for carbon ions and that both diffusion constants are 80 or
more times smaller than diffusion constants in the liquid phase. There is
excellent agreement between our carbon-oxygen phase diagram and that predicted
by Medin and Cumming. This suggests that errors from finite size and
non-equilibrium effects are small and that the carbon-oxygen phase diagram is
now accurately known. The oxygen-selenium system is a simple two-component
model for more complex rapid proton capture nucleosynthesis ash compositions
for an accreting neutron star. Diffusion of oxygen, in a predominately selenium
crystal, is remarkably fast, comparable to diffusion in the liquid phase. We
find a somewhat lower melting temperature for the oxygen-selenium system than
that predicted by Medin and Cumming. This is probably because of electron
screening effects.

"Quantifying the Energetics and Length Scales of Carbon Segregation to Fe
  Symmetric Tilt Grain Boundaries Using Atomistic Simulations","  Segregation of impurities to grain boundaries plays an important role in both
the stability and macroscopic behavior of polycrystalline materials. The
research objective in this work is to better characterize the energetics and
length scales involved with the process of solute and impurity segregation to
grain boundaries. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to calculate the
segregation energies for carbon within multiple grain boundary sites over a
database of 125 symmetric tilt grain boundaries in Fe. The simulation results
show that the majority of atomic sites near the grain boundary have segregation
energies lower than in the bulk. Moreover, depending on the boundary, the
segregation energies approach the bulk value approximately 5-12 \AA\ away from
the center of the grain boundary, providing an energetic length scale for
carbon segregation. A subsequent data reduction and statistical representation
of this dataset provides critical information such as about the mean
segregation energy and the associated energy distributions for carbon atoms as
a function of distance from the grain boundary, which quantitatively informs
higher scale models with energetics and length scales necessary for capturing
the segregation behavior of impurities in Fe. The significance of this research
is the development of a methodology capable of ascertaining segregation
energies over a wide range of grain boundary character (typical of that
observed in polycrystalline materials), which herein has been applied to carbon
segregation in a specific class of grain boundaries in iron.

"A carbon dwarf wearing a Necklace: first proof of accretion in a
  post-common-envelope binary central star of a planetary nebula with jets","  The formation of collimated outflows or jets in planetary nebulae (PNe) is
not well understood. There is no evidence for active accretion disks in PNe
making it difficult to decide which of several proposed jet formation scenarios
may be correct. A handful of wide binary central stars of PNe are known to have
accreted carbon and slow neutron capture (s-process) enhanced material, the
immediate progenitors of barium stars, however no close binary analogues are
known to have passed through a common-envelope (CE) phase. Here we present
spectroscopy of The Necklace taken near lightcurve minimum that for the first
time reveals a carbon-rich (C/O > 1) companion, a carbon dwarf, in a post-CE
central star. As unevolved stars do not produce carbon, the chemical
enhancement of the secondary can only be explained by accretion from the
primary. Accretion most likely happened prior to the CE phase via wind
accretion as not enough material can be accreted during the short CE phase. The
pair of jets in The Necklace, which are observed to be older than the PN, are
therefore likely to have been launched from an accretion disk around the
companion during this early accretion phase. This discovery adds significant
weight to the emerging scenario that jets in post-CE PNe are primarily launched
by an accretion disk around a main-sequence companion before the CE phase.

"Multiscale metabolic modeling of C4 plants: connecting nonlinear
  genome-scale models to leaf-scale metabolism in developing maize leaves","  C4 plants, such as maize, concentrate carbon dioxide in a specialized
compartment surrounding the veins of their leaves to improve the efficiency of
carbon dioxide assimilation. Nonlinear relationships between carbon dioxide and
oxygen levels and reaction rates are key to their physiology but cannot be
handled with standard techniques of constraint-based metabolic modeling. We
demonstrate that incorporating these relationships as constraints on reaction
rates and solving the resulting nonlinear optimization problem yields realistic
predictions of the response of C4 systems to environmental and biochemical
perturbations. Using a new genome-scale reconstruction of maize metabolism, we
build an 18000-reaction, nonlinearly constrained model describing mesophyll and
bundle sheath cells in 15 segments of the developing maize leaf, interacting
via metabolite exchange, and use RNA-seq and enzyme activity measurements to
predict spatial variation in metabolic state by a novel method that optimizes
correlation between fluxes and expression data. Though such correlations are
known to be weak in general, here the predicted fluxes achieve high correlation
with the data, successfully capture the experimentally observed base-to-tip
transition between carbon-importing tissue and carbon-exporting tissue, and
include a nonzero growth rate, in contrast to prior results from similar
methods in other systems. We suggest that developmental gradients may be
particularly suited to the inference of metabolic fluxes from expression data.

"Discrete Element Simulation of Transverse Cracking During the Pyrolysis
  of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics to Carbon/Carbon Composites","  The fracture behavior of fiber-ceramics like C/C-SiC strongly depends on the
initial damage arising during the production process. We study the transverse
cracking of the 90{\deg} ply in [0/90]S cross-ply laminates due to the
thermochemical degradation of the matrix material during the carbonization
process by means of a discrete element method. The crack morphology strongly
depends on the fiber-matrix interface properties, the transverse ply thickness
as well as on the carbonization process itself. To model the 90{\deg} ply a
two-dimensional triangular lattice of springs is constructed where nodes of the
lattice represent fibers. Springs with random breaking thresholds model the
disordered matrix material and interfaces. The spring-lattice is coupled by
interface springs to two rigid bars which capture the two 0{\deg} plies or
adjacent sublaminates in the model. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to
follow the time evolution of the model system. It was found that under gradual
heating of the specimen, after some distributed cracking, segmentation cracks
occur in the 90{\deg} ply which then develop into a saturated state where the
ply cannot support additional load. The dependence of the micro-structure of
damage on the ply thickness and on the disorder in spring properties is also
studied. Crack density and porosity of the system are monitored as a function
of the temperature and compared to an analytic approach and experiments.

"Lithium in CEMP-no stars: A new constraint on the lithium depletion
  mechanism in the early universe","  Most of relatively warm, unevolved metal-poor stars ($T_{\rm eff}\gtrsim
5800\,\mathrm{K}$ and $[{\rm Fe/H}]\lesssim -1.5$) exhibit almost constant
lithium abundances, irrespective of metallicity or effective temperature, and
thus form the so-called Spite plateau. This was originally interpreted as
arising from lithium created by the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Recent
observations, however, have revealed that ultra metal-poor stars (UMP stars;
$[\mathrm{Fe/H}]<-4.0$) have significantly lower lithium abundances than that
of the plateau. Since most of the UMP stars are CEMP-no stars, carbon-enhanced
metal-poor stars with no excess of neutron-capture elements, a connection
between the carbon enhancement and lithium depletion is suspected. A
straightforward approach to this question is to investigate carbon-normal UMP
stars. However only one object is known in this class. As an alternative, we
have determined lithium abundances for two CEMP-no main-sequence turn-off stars
with metallicities $[{\rm Fe/H}]\sim -3.0$, where there are numerous
carbon-normal stars with available lithium abundances that can be considered.
Our 1D LTE analysis indicates that the two CEMP-no stars have lithium
abundances that are consistent with values near the plateau, which suggests
that carbon enhancement and lithium depletion are not directly related.
Instead, our results suggest that extremely low iron abundance is a fundamental
cause to depleted lithium in UMP stars.

Accretion-Induced Collapse From Helium Star + White Dwarf Binaries,"  Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) occurs when an O/Ne white dwarf (WD) grows
to nearly the Chandrasekhar mass ($M_{\rm Ch}$), reaching central densities
that trigger electron captures in the core. Using Modules for Experiments in
Stellar Astrophysics ($\texttt{MESA}$), we present the first true binary
simulations of He star + O/Ne WD binaries, focusing on a $1.5 M_\odot$ He star
in a 3 hour orbital period with $1.1-1.3 M_\odot$ O/Ne WDs. The helium star
fills its Roche lobe after core helium burning is completed and donates helium
on its thermal timescale to the WD, $\dot{M}\approx3\times10^{-6} M_\odot$/yr,
a rate high enough that the accreting helium burns stably on the WD. The
accumulated carbon/oxygen ashes from the helium burning undergo an unstable
shell flash that initiates an inwardly moving carbon burning flame. This flame
is only quenched when it runs out of carbon at the surface of the original O/Ne
core. Subsequent accumulation of fresh carbon/oxygen layers also undergo
thermal instabilities, but no mass loss is triggered, allowing $M_{\rm
WD}\rightarrow M_{\rm Ch}$, triggering the onset of AIC. We also discuss the
scenario of accreting C/O WDs that experience shell carbon ignitions to become
O/Ne WDs, and then, under continuing mass transfer, lead to AIC. Studies of the
AIC event rate using binary population synthesis should include all of these
channels, especially this latter channel, which has been previously neglected
but might dominate the rate.

"J-type carbon stars: A dominant source of 14N-rich presolar SiC grains

14N-rich AB (14N/15N>440, AB2) and 15 mainstream (MS) grains, and their
correlated Sr and Ba isotope ratios when available. Direct comparison of the
data for the MS grains, which came from low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars with large s-process isotope enhancements, with the AB2 grain data
demonstrates that AB2 grains show near-solar isotopic compositions and lack
s-process enhancements. The near-normal Sr, Mo, and Ba isotopic compositions of
AB2 grains clearly exclude born-again AGB stars, where the intermediate
neutron-capture process (i-process) takes place, as their stellar source. On
the other hand, low-mass CO novae, and early R- and J-type carbon stars show
13C and 14N excesses but no s-process enhancements and are thus potential
stellar sources of AB2 grains. Since both early R-type carbon stars and CO
novae are rare objects, the abundant J-type carbon stars (10-15% of all carbon

"Hydrogen Penetration and Fuel Cell Vehicle Deployment in the Carbon

hydrogen penetration into a carbon constrained energy system to the year 2050.
Focusing on minimum and maximum penetration scenarios, an investigation of
global fuel cell vehicle (FCV) deployment is undertaken, cognizant of optimal
economic deployment at the global level and stakeholder preferences in a case
study of Japan. The model is mathematically formulated as a very large-scale
linear optimization problem, aiming to minimize system costs, including
generation type, fuel costs, conversion costs, and carbon reduction costs,
subject to the constraint of carbon dioxide reductions for each nation. Results
show that between approximately 0.8% and 2% of global energy consumption needs
can be met by hydrogen out to the year 2050, with city gas and transport
emerging as significant use cases. Passenger FCVs and hydrogen buses account
for almost all of the hydrogen-based transportation sector, leading to a global
deployment of approximately 120 million FCVs by 2050. Hydrogen production is
reliant on fossil fuels, and OECD nations are net importers - especially Japan
with a 100% import case. To underpin hydrogen production from fossil fuels,
carbon capture and storage (CCS) is required in significant quantities when
anticipating a large fleet of FCVs. Stakeholder engagement suggests optimism
toward FCV deployment while policy issues identified include necessity for
large-scale future energy system investment and rapid technical and economic

emphasizes on the effect of atomic mass of the plume species on the diamagnetic

between the copper and carbon plasma plumes in terms of formation of
diamagnetic cavity and structure formation. An elliptical cavity-like structure
is observed in case of copper plasma plume which attains the sharp conical
shape with increasing the time delay or magnetic field strength. On the other
hand, splitted carbon plasma plume appears as a Y-shape structure in the
presence of magnetic field where the cavity-like structure is not observed for

Junkyard Computing: Repurposing Discarded Smartphones to Minimize Carbon,"  1.5 billion smartphones are sold annually, and most are decommissioned less

stockpile represents a substantial wasted potential: modern smartphones have
increasingly high-performance and energy-efficient processors, extensive

studies the ability to reuse smartphones as ""junkyard computers."" Junkyard
computers grow global computing capacity by extending device lifetimes, which
supplants the manufacture of new devices. We show that the capabilities of even
decade-old smartphones are within those demanded by modern cloud microservices
and discuss how to combine phones to perform increasingly complex tasks. We
describe how current operation-focused metrics do not capture the actual carbon
costs of compute. We propose Computational Carbon Intensity -- a performance
metric that balances the continued service of older devices with the
superlinear runtime improvements of newer machines. We use this metric to
redefine device service lifetime in terms of carbon efficiency. We develop a
cloudlet of reused Pixel 3A phones. We analyze the carbon benefits of deploying
large, end-to-end microservice-based applications on these smartphones.

"Graph-Based Optimization for Technology Pathway Analysis: A Case Study
  in Decarbonization of University Campuses","  Industrial sectors such as urban centers, chemical companies, manufacturing
facilities, and microgrids are actively exploring strategies to help reduce
their carbon footprint. For instance, university campuses are complex urban
districts (involving collections of buildings and utility systems) that are
seeking to reduce carbon footprints that originate from diverse activities
(e.g., transportation operations and production of heating, cooling, and power
utilities). This work presents an optimization framework to identify technology
pathways that enable decarbonization of complex industrial sectors. The
framework uses a graph abstraction that compactly captures interdependencies
between diverse products and technologies as well as diverse externalities
(e.g., market, policy, and carbon prices). Duality analysis reveals that the
formulation can be interpreted as an economy, market, or value chain that uses
technologies to generate economic value (wealth) by transforming basic products
into higher value products. This interpretation also reveals that the
formulation identifies pathways that maximize the profit of stakeholders, helps
reveal the inherent value (prices) of intermediate products, and helps analyze
the impact of externalities and technology specifications on product values.
Our developments are illustrated via a case study involving a prototypical
university campus that seeks to identify pathways that reduce its carbon
footprint (e.g., via electrification and deployment of hydrogen technologies).
We use the framework to determine carbon tax values, technology specifications,
and investment budgets that activate different technology pathways and that
achieve different levels of decarbonization.

Quantum Simulations for Carbon Capture on Metal-Organic Frameworks,"  Direct air capture of Carbon Dioxide is a technical solution that does not
rely on natural processes to capture CO2 from the atmosphere. In DAC, the
filter material is designed to specifically bind CO2 molecules. Hence a
high-capacity filter is sought. We aim to leverage the potential of quantum
computing to improve the filters used in DAC. Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)
have high surface area and tunable pore sizes which makes them an attractive
material for gas storage and separation. Using the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, we find the minimum of the potential energy
surface (PES) by first considering only the active site of the MOF (the metal
ion). For complex systems, we employ Density Matrix Embedding Theory and use
VQE as a fragment solver at the binding site. Techniques like
deparameterisation are used to minimise the count of trainable parameters. We
present results of ideal and noisy simulations as well as from a real hardware
device. Resources are estimated for MOFs unit cell. The findings from our study

  new Ultra Metal-Poor Stars","  We present an elemental abundance analysis for four newly discovered ultra
metal-poor stars from the Hamburg/ESO survey, with $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\leq-4$.
Based on high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra, we derive abundances
for 17 elements in the range from Li to Ba. Three of the four stars exhibit
moderate to large over-abundances of carbon, but have no enhancements in their
neutron-capture elements. The most metal-poor star in the sample,
HE~0233$-$0343 ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]} = -4.68$), is a subgiant with a carbon
enhancement of $\mathrm{[C/Fe]}= +3.5$, slightly above the carbon-enhancement
plateau suggested by Spite et al. No carbon is detected in the spectrum of the
fourth star, but the quality of its spectrum only allows for the determination
of an upper limit on the carbon abundance ratio of $\mathrm{[C/Fe]} < +1.7$. We
detect lithium in the spectra of two of the carbon-enhanced stars, including
HE~0233$-$0343. Both stars with Li detections are Li-depleted, with respect to
the Li plateau for metal-poor dwarfs found by Spite \& Spite. This suggests
that whatever site(s) produced C either do not completely destroy lithium, or
that Li has been astrated by early-generation stars and mixed with primordial
Li in the gas that formed the stars observed at present. The derived abundances
for the $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements of the four stars are similar
to those found in previous large samples of extremely and ultra metal-poor
stars. Finally, a large spread is found in the abundances of Sr and Ba for
these stars, possibly influenced by enrichment from fast rotating stars in the
early universe.

"The role of binaries in the enrichment of the early Galactic halo. II.
  Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Stars - CEMP-no stars","  The detailed composition of most metal-poor halo stars has been found to be
very uniform. However, a fraction of 20-70% (increasing with decreasing
metallicity) exhibit dramatic enhancements in their abundances of carbon - the
so-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. A key question for Galactic
chemical evolution models is whether this non-standard composition reflects
that of the stellar natal clouds, or is due to local, post-birth mass transfer
of chemically processed material from a binary companion; CEMP stars should
then all be members of binary systems. Our aim is to determine the frequency
and orbital parameters of binaries among CEMP stars with and without
over-abundances of neutron-capture elements - CEMP-s and CEMP-no stars,
respectively - as a test of this local mass-transfer scenario. This paper
discusses a sample of 24 CEMP-no stars, while a subsequent paper will consider
a similar sample of CEMP-s stars. Most programme stars exhibit no statistically
significant radial-velocit variation over this period and appear to be single,
while four are found to be binaries with orbital periods of 300-2,000 days and
normal eccentricity; the binary frequency for the sample is 17+-9%. The single
stars mostly belong to the recently-identified ``low-C band'', while the
binaries have higher absolute carbon abundances. We conclude that the
nucleosynthetic process responsible for the strong carbon excess in these
ancient stars is unrelated to their binary status; the carbon was imprinted on
their natal molecular clouds in the early Galactic ISM by an even earlier,
external source, strongly indicating that the CEMP-no stars are likely bona
fide second-generation stars. We discuss potential production sites for carbon
and its transfer across interstellar distances in the early ISM, and
implications for the composition of high-redshift DLA systems. Abridged.

"Mathematical modelling of carbon capture in a packed column by
  adsorption","  A mathematical model of the process of carbon capture in a packed column by
adsorption is developed and analysed. First a detailed study is made of the
governing equations. Due to the complexity of the internal geometry it is
standard practice to average these equations. Here the averaging process is
revisited. This shows that there exists a number of errors and some confusion
in the standard systems studied in the literature. These errors affect the
parameter estimation, with consequences when the experimental set-up is
modified or scaled-up. Assuming, as a first approximation, an isothermal model
the gas concentration equation is solved numerically. Excellent agreement with
data from a pressure swing adsorption experiment is demonstrated. A new
analytical solution (valid away from the inlet) is obtained. This provides
explicit relations for quantities such as the amount of adsorbed gas, time of
first breakthrough, total process time and width and speed of the reaction
zone, showing how these depend on the operating conditions and material
parameters. The relations show clearly how to optimise the carbon capture
process. By comparison with experimental data the analytical solution may also
be used to calculate unknown system parameters.

Performance-based screening of porous materials for carbon capture,"  Computational screening methods have been accelerating discovery of new
materials and deployment of technologies based on them in many areas from
batteries and alloys to photovoltaics and separation processes. In this review,
we focus on post-combustion carbon capture using adsorption in porous
materials. Prompted by unprecedented developments in material science,
researchers in material engineering, molecular simulations, and process
modelling have been interested in finding the best materials for carbon capture
using energy efficient pressure-swing adsorption processes. Recent efforts have
been directed towards development of new multiscale and performance-based
screening workflows where we are able to go from the atomistic structure of an
adsorbent to its equilibrium and transport properties for gas adsorption, and
eventually to its separation performance in the actual process. The objective
of this article is to review the current status of these emerging approaches,
explain their significance for materials screening, while at the same time
highlighting the existing pitfalls and challenges that limit their application
in practice and industry. It is also the intention of this review to encourage
cross-disciplinary collaborations for the development of more advanced
screening methodologies. For this specific reason, we undertake an additional
task of compiling and introducing all the elements that are needed for the
development and operation of the performance-based screening workflows,
including information about available materials databases, state-of-the-art
molecular simulation and process modelling tools and methods, and the full list
of data and parameters required for each stage.

Optimal pricing for carbon dioxide removal under inter-regional leakage,"  Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) moves atmospheric carbon to geological or
land-based sinks. In a first-best setting, the optimal use of CDR is achieved
by a removal subsidy that equals the optimal carbon tax and marginal damages.
We derive second-best policy rules for CDR subsidies and carbon taxes when no
global carbon price exists but a national government implements a unilateral
climate policy. We find that the optimal carbon tax differs from an optimal CDR
subsidy because of carbon leakage and a balance of resource trade effect.
First, the optimal removal subsidy tends to be larger than the carbon tax
because of lower supply-side leakage on fossil resource markets. Second, net
carbon exporters exacerbate this wedge to increase producer surplus of their
carbon resource producers, implying even larger removal subsidies. Third, net
carbon importers may set their removal subsidy even below their carbon tax when
marginal environmental damages are small, to appropriate producer surplus from
carbon exporters.

"Radial and vertical dust transport inhibit refractory carbon depletion
  in protoplanetary disks","  The Earth is strongly depleted in carbon compared to the dust in the ISM,
implying efficient removal of refractory carbon before parent body formation.
It has been argued that grains get rid of their carbon through oxidation and
photolysis in the exposed upper disk layers. We assess the efficacy of these
C-removal mechanisms accounting for the vertical and radial transport of
grains. We obtain the carbon and carbon free mass budget of solids by solving
two 1D advection-diffusion equations, accounting for the dust grain size
distribution and radial transport. The carbon removal acts on the fraction of
the grains that are in the exposed layer and requires efficient vertical
transport. In models without radial transport, oxidation and photolysis can
destroy most of the refractory carbon in terrestrial planet formation region.
But it only reaches the observed depletion levels for extreme parameter
combinations and requires that parent body formation was delayed by 1 Myr.
Adding radial transport of solids prevents the depletion entirely, leaving
refractory carbon equally distributed throughout the disk. It is unlikely that
the observed carbon depletion can ultimately be attributed to mechanisms
operating on small grains in the disk surface layers. Other mechanisms need to
be studied, for example flash heating events or FU Ori outbursts in order to
remove carbon quickly and deeply. However, a sustained drift barrier or
strongly reduced radial grain mobility are necessary to prevent replenishment
of carbon from the outer disk.

Valorizing the carbon byproduct of methane pyrolysis in batteries,"  While low-cost natural gas remains abundant, the energy content of this fuel
can be utilized without greenhouse gas emissions through the production of
molecular hydrogen and solid carbon via methane pyrolysis. In the absence of a
carbon tax, methane pyrolysis is not economically competitive with current
hydrogen production methods unless the carbon byproducts can be valorized. In
this work, we assess the viability of the carbon byproduct produced from
methane pyrolysis in molten salts as high-value-added anode or conductive
additive for secondary Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Raman characterization and
electrochemical differential capacity analysis demonstrate that the use of
molten salt mixtures with catalytically-active FeCl3- or MnCl2 result in more
graphitic carbon co-products. These graphitic carbons exhibit the best
electrochemical performance (up to 272 mAh/g of reversible capacity) when used
as Li-ion anodes. For all carbon samples studied here, disordered carbon
domains and retained salt species trapped and/or intercalated into the carbon
structure were identified by X-ray photoelectron and multinuclear solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The latter lead to reduced
electrochemical activity and reversibility, and poorer rate performance
compared to commercial carbon anodes. The electronic conductivity of the
pyrolyzed carbons is found to be highly dependent on their purity, with the
purest carbon exhibiting an electronic conductivity nearly on par with that of
commercial carbon additives. These findings suggest that more effective removal
of the salt catalyst could enable applications of these carbons in secondary
batteries, providing a financial incentive for the large-scale implementation
of methane pyrolysis for low-carbon hydrogen production.

"Comparison of H2 and He carbon cleaning mechanisms in extreme
  ultraviolet induced and surface wave discharge plasmas","  Cleaning of contamination of optical surfaces by amorphous carbon (a-C) is
highly relevant for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. We have studied the
mechanisms for a-C removal from a Si surface. By comparing a-C removal in a
surface wave discharge (SWD) plasma and an EUV-induced plasma, the cleaning
mechanisms for hydrogen and helium gas environments were determined. The C-atom
removal per incident ion was estimated for different sample bias voltages and
ion fluxes. It was found that H2 plasmas generally had higher cleaning rates
than He plasmas: up to seven times higher for more negatively biased samples in
EUV induced plasma. Moreover, for H2, EUV induced plasma was found to be 2-3
times more efficient at removing carbon than the SWD plasma. It was observed
carbon removal during exposure to He is due to physical sputtering by He+ ions.
In H2, on the other hand, the increase in carbon removal rates is due to
chemical sputtering. This is a new C cleaning mechanism for EUV-induced plasma,
which we call ""EUV-reactive ion sputtering"".

"Mass-Balance MRV for Carbon Dioxide Removal by Enhanced Rock Weathering:
  Methods, Simulation, and Inference","  Carbon dioxide will likely need to be removed from the atmosphere to avoid
significant future warming and climate change. Technologies are being developed
to remove large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere. Enhanced rock
weathering (ERW), where fine-grained silicate minerals are spread on soil, is a
promising carbon removal method that can also support crop yields and maintain
overall soil health. Quantifying the amount of carbon removed by ERW is crucial
for understanding the potential of ERW globally and for building trust in
commercial operations. However, reliable and scalable quantification in complex
media like soil is challenging and there is not yet a consensus on the best
method of doing so. Here we discuss mass-balance methods, where stocks of base
cations in soil are monitored over time to infer the amount of inorganic carbon
brought into solution by weathering reactions. First, we review the fundamental
concepts of mass-balance methods and explain different ways of approaching the
mass-balance problem. Then we discuss experimental planning and data
collection, suggesting some best practices. Next, we present a software package
designed to facilitate a range of tasks in ERW like uncertainty analysis,
planning field trials, and validating statistical methods. Finally, we briefly
review ways of estimating carbon removal using mass balance before discussing
some advantages of Bayesian inference in this context and presenting an example
Bayesian model. The model is fit to simulated data and recovers the correct
answer with a clear representation of uncertainty.

"Electrosynthetic control of CNT conductivity & morphology: Scale-up of

Why carbon dioxide makes stellarators so important,"  The increasing level of atmospheric carbon dioxide has driven public
discourse throughout the world. An immediate implementation of carbon-free
energy sources is demanded with little discussion of costs, technical
constraints on the sources, or implications of high residual levels of carbon
dioxide. Residual carbon-dioxide can be removed from the air, but the cost to
remove the carbon-dioxide produced by human activity during a year is thought
to be trillions of dollars---otherwise it remains in the atmosphere for
centuries. Economic considerations may limit wind and solar sources to less
than 40\% of the electricity production. Fission or fusion may be the only
choice for most of the rest. Development costs are orders of magnitude smaller
than implementation costs, which are tens of trillions of dollars for fission.
A needless delay in the development of fusion has enormous financial
implications. As will be shown stellarators are better positioned than any
other concept for a fast path to fusion. A computationally derived conceptual
design for a stellarator reactor may allow final design and construction to be
initiated without the delay of intermediate generations of experiments. The
most urgent issue is the development of conceptual designs.

"Combination effect of growth enhancers and carbon sources on synthesis
  of single-walled carbon nanotubes from solid carbon growth seeds","  In the synthesis of highly crystalline single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs), high growth temperatures are preferred, while the formation of
impurity amorphous carbon (a-C) causes the termination of SWCNT growth and
degrades its properties. To remove this by-product, H2O and CO2 have been
employed in metal-catalyzed SWCNT growth systems because of their oxidizing
ability. Recently, nonmetallic nanoparticles have become one of the growth seed
candidates because of their high melting points and fewer metal impurities. In
this study, by using nanodiamond-derived carbon nanoparticles as the solid
growth seeds, we investigated the effect of CO2 and H2O on high-temperature
SWCNT growth with two types of carbon-source supplies: C2H2 and C2H4. In this
growth system, H2O showed oxidizing ability to etch a-C with either carbon
sources. CO2 exhibited a similar a-C formation-preventing role in C2H4-supplied
growth and achieved higher-purity SWCNTs with higher concentration of C2H4 than
the case of H2O. However, in contrast to the other combinations, CO2 injection
in the C2H2-supplied growth significantly enhanced the formation of a-C rather
than the removal of it while the yield of SWCNTs was also increased, indicating
the occurrence of the dehydration reaction between CO2 and C2H2. The present
findings will lead to efficient growth of high-quality SWCNTs from nonmetallic
growth seeds with the use of growth enhancers.

Single-nucleon removal cross sections on nucleon and nuclear targets,"  The eikonal direct-reaction model, as used in spectroscopic studies of
intermediate-energy nucleon-removal reactions on light target nuclei, is
considered in the case of a proton target and applied to neutron removal from
$^{29}$Ne at 240 MeV/nucleon. The computed cross sections and their
sensitivities are compared using an earlier detailed analysis of carbon target
data. The nuclear structure input, for the $^{29}$Ne ground-state and $^{28}$Ne
final states, is that deduced from the carbon target analysis. The comparisons
quantify the sensitivity of the two reactions to the angular momenta and
binding energies of the active valence orbitals - showing the carbon target to
be relatively more efficient for removals from weakly-bound, low-$\ell$,
halo-like orbitals. Probing this sensitivity experimentally would provide
useful tests of these predictions and of the model's description of the
reaction mechanism.

"Characterization and Evaluation of Carbonaceous Materials from the
  Hydrothermal Carbonization of Waste Pharmaceuticals","  In this paper, we report herein, the conversion of waste prescription and
non-prescription pharmaceuticals into carbonaceous materials. The hydrothermal
carbonization (HTC) of the pharmaceuticals was carried out at temperatures of
180, 230 and 275 0C in closed reactors for 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively.
The main products from the carbonization process were in the solids, liquids
and gas phases. The resulting hydrochars were shown to be very functionalized
with a high degree of aromaticity and high carbon content (between 55% to 65%).
The adsorptive capacity of the hydrochars to remove Pb2+ ions from an aqueous
system was evaluated and compared to that of analytical reagent activated
carbon (AR-AC) through batch adsorptive tests. The effect of contact time on
batch adsorption experiments with an initial Pb2+ concentration of 50 mg/L was
also evaluated. The results indicated that PH24_230 has a better adsorption
capacity when compared to AR-AC; achieving over 97% removal of Pb2+ after 60
minutes. The batch adsorption studies were best described by the pseudo-second
order kinetic model with coefficient of regression (R2) values above 0.99.
Also, slow pyrolysis experiments were carried out to evaluate the difference in
solid yields, char heating value and surface area. Pyrochar yields were
slightly higher, while heating values were one order of magnitude lower when
compared to hydrochars. The pyrolysis conducted at 700{\deg}C led to the
pyrochar with the highest value of the surface area (63.15 m2/g). The study
shows that valuable products can be generated successfully from the
hydrothermal carbonization of waste pharmaceuticals.

"Heterophased grain boundary-rich superparamagnetic Iron Oxides/carbon
  composite for Cationic and Anionic Dye Removal","  Iron oxide-based nanostructures receive significant attention as an efficient
adsorbent for organic dyes removal. The removal properties have strong
dependency on the stoichiometry, phases, reactive edges, defect states etc
present in the iron-oxides nanostructures. Herein, iron oxide/carbon composite
with well-defined heterophased grain boundaries is synthesized by simple
precipitation method and followed by calcination. The local structure, spin
dynamics and magnetic properties of heterophased iron oxides/carbon composite
are thoroughly investigated to explore its cationic and anionic dye removal
capability. To validate the effectivity of the presence of heterogeneous grain
boundaries, iron oxide/carbon nanocomposite with homogeneous grain boundaries
is also examined. It was found that the hetero-phased iron oxide/carbon showed
removal capacity of 35.45 mg g-1 and 45.84 mg g-1 for cationic (Crystal Violet)
and anionic (Congo Red) dyes, respectively as compared to that of
as-synthesised imidazole-capped superparamagnetic {\alpha}-Fe2O3 (25.11 mg g-1
and 40.44 mg g-1, respectively) and homophased iron oxide/carbon nanocomposite
(9.41 mg g-1 and 5.43 mg g-1, respectively). The plausible mechanism on the
local structural evolution of the heterophase in the course of calcination and
increase of the removal capacity is discussed. A detailed dye adsorption
investigation is presented including the adsorption kinetic study. The
pseudo-second order kinetic model is found to be an appropriate one and
suggests that the chemisorption is dominant factor leading to adsorption of
dyes. Whereas Weber-Morris model indicate the strong influence of boundary
layers of nanocomposite on the adsorption process.

"Energy System Digitization in the Era of AI: A Three-Layered Approach
  towards Carbon Neutrality","  The transition towards carbon-neutral electricity is one of the biggest game
changers in addressing climate change since it addresses the dual challenges of
removing carbon emissions from the two largest sectors of emitters: electricity
and transportation. The transition to a carbon-neutral electric grid poses
significant challenges to conventional paradigms of modern grid planning and
operation. Much of the challenge arises from the scale of the decision making
and the uncertainty associated with the energy supply and demand. Artificial
Intelligence (AI) could potentially have a transformative impact on
accelerating the speed and scale of carbon-neutral transition, as many decision
making processes in the power grid can be cast as classic, though challenging,

Implementation Guidance for Wood Harvesting and Storage,"  This implementation guidance focuses on carbon removal and sequestration via
wood harvesting and storage (WHS), a process where woody biomass, with the
embedded carbon, is stored for long timescales in shallow geologic storage. The
engineering structure designed to ensure such durable storage by preventing
biomass decomposition is called a Wood Vault.
  This guidance contains the requirements for a basic Wood Vault project, and
is intended to aid project developers, verifiers, and registries in this space.
It describes a set of requirements that govern the end-to-end process of carbon
removal and sequestration. This includes carbon accounting, wood sourcing via
wood residual (WR) utilization, Wood Vault construction and maintenance, as
well as processes for monitoring, verification, and credit issuance. Carbon
accounting requirements include baseline, or counterfactual specification, and
full life cycle analysis (LCA) within a specified process boundary. For the
vault itself, the guidance describes a buried vault with the burial chamber
covered by a layer of low permeability material to create anoxic condition.
Other types of vaults can also be used to adjust to local environmental,
transport, and economic constraints. Monitoring and verification requirements
include in-situ sensors, gas sampling, sample excavations, and site
maintenance. This guidance also contemplates land ownership and legal
assurances, as well as environmental and societal impact assessments.
  The implementation guidance concludes with recommendations regarding
auditing, certification and carbon credit issuance.

"Impact of Neutron Irradiation on LGADs with a Carbon-Enriched Shallow
  Multiplication Layer: Degradation of Timing Performance and Gain","  In this radiation tolerance study, Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) with
a carbon-enriched broad and shallow multiplication layer were examined in
comparison to identical non-carbonated LGADs. Manufactured at IMB-CNM, the
sensors underwent neutron irradiation at the TRIGA reactor in Ljubljana,
reaching a fluence of $1.5e^{15} {n_{eq}} cm^{-2}$. The results revealed a
smaller deactivation of boron and improved resistance to radiation in
carbonated LGADs. The study demonstrated the potential benefits of carbon
enrichment in mitigating radiation damage effects, particularly the acceptor
removal mechanism, reducing the acceptor removal constant by more than a factor
of two. Additionally, time resolution and collected charge degradation due to
irradiation were observed, with carbonated samples exhibiting better radiation
tolerance. A noise analysis focused on baseline noise and spurious pulses
showed the presence of thermal-generated dark counts attributed to a too narrow
distance between the gain layer end and the p-stop implant at the periphery of
the pad for the characterized LGAD design; however, without significant impact
of operation performance.

"Performance enhancement of TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells by
  carbon nanospheres in photoanode","  The conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is optimized
by modifying the optical design and improving absorbance within the cell. These
objectives are obtained by creating different sized cavities in TiO2
photoanode. For this purpose, carbon nanospheres with diameters 100-600 nm are
synthesized by hydrothermal method. A paste of TiO2 is mixed with various
amounts of carbon nanospheres. During TiO2 photoanode sintering processes at
500C temperature, the carbon nanospheres are removed. This leads to random
creation of cavities in the DSSCs photoanode. These cavities enhance light
scattering and porosity which improve light absorbance by dye N719 and provide
a larger surface area for dye loading. These consequences enhance performance
of DSSCs. By mixing 3% Wt. carbon nanospheres in the TiO2 pastes, we were able
to increase the short circuit current density and efficiency by 40% (from 12.59

Tunable magnetism of a single-carbon vacancy in graphene,"  Removing a single-carbon vacancy introduces (quasi-)localized states for both
and electrons in graphene. Interactions between the localized dangling bond and
quasilocalized electrons of a single-carbon vacancy in graphene are predicted
to control its magnetism. However, experimentally confirming this prediction
through manipulating the interactions between the and electrons remains an
outstanding challenge. Here we report the manipulation of magnetism of
individual single-carbon vacancy in graphene by using a scanning tunnelling
microscopy (STM) tip. Our spin-polarized STM measurements, complemented by
density functional theory calculations, indicate that interactions between the
localized and quasilocalized electrons could split the electrons into two
states with opposite spins even when they are well above the Fermi level. Via
the STM tip, we successfully manipulate both the magnitude and direction of
magnetic moment of the electrons with respect to that of the electrons. Three
different magnetic states of the single-carbon vacancy, exhibiting magnetic
moments of about 1.6, 0.5, and 0 respectively, are realized in our experiment.

"The spatial distribution of carbon dust in the early solar nebula and
  the carbon content of planetesimals","  A high fraction of carbon bound in solid carbonaceous material is observed to
exist in bodies formed in the cold outskirts of the solar nebula, while bodies
in the terrestrial planets region contain nearly none. We study the fate of the
carbonaceous material during the spiral-in of matter as the sun accretes matter
from the solar nebula. From observational data on the composition of the dust
component in comets and interplanetary dust particles, and from data on
pyrolysis experiments, we construct a model for the composition of the pristine
carbonaceous material in the outer parts of the solar nebula. We study the
pyrolysis of the refractory and volatile organic component and the concomitant
release of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons under quiescent conditions of
disk evolution where matter migrates inwards. We also study the decomposition
and oxidation of the carbonaceous material during violent flash heating events,
which are thought to be responsible for the formation of chondrules. It is
found that the complex hydrocarbon components are removed from the solid disk
matter at temperatures between 250 and 400 K, while the amorphous carbon
component survives up to 1200 K. Without efficient carbon destruction during
flash-heating associated with chondrule formation the carbon abundance of
terrestrial planets, except for Mercury, would be not as low as it is found in
cosmochemical studies. Chondrule formation seems to be a process that is
crucial for the carbon-poor composition of the material of terrestrial planets.

"Controlled Transition Metal Nucleated Growth of Carbon Nanotubes by
  Molten Electrolysis of CO$_2$","  The electrolysis of CO$_2$ in molten carbonate has been introduced as an
alternative mechanism to synthesize carbon nanomaterials inexpensively at high
yield. Until recently, CO$_2$ was thought to be unreactive, making its removal
a challenge. CO$_2$ is the main cause of anthropogenic global warming and its
utilization and transformation into a stable, valuable material provides an
incentivized pathway to mitigate climate change. This study focuses on
controlled electrochemical conditions in molten lithium carbonate to split
CO$_2$ absorbed from the atmosphere into into carbon nanotubes, and into
various macroscopic assemblies of CNTs,, which may be useful for
nano-filtration. Different CNTs, morphologies were prepared electrochemically
by variation of the anode and cathode composition and architecture, electrolyte
composition pre-electrolysis processing, and the variation of current
application and current density. Individual CNT morphologies structures and the
CNT molten carbonate growth mechanism are explored by SEM, TEM, HAADF EDX, XRD
and Raman. The principle commercial technology for CNT production had been
chemical vapor deposition, which is an order of magnitude more expensive,
generally requires metallo-organics, rather than CO$_2$ as reactants, and can
be highly energy and CO$_2$ emission intensive (carries a high carbon positive,
rather than negative, footprint).

Carbon Depletion in the Early Solar System,"  Earth and other rocky objects in the inner Solar System are depleted in
carbon compared to objects in the outer Solar System, the Sun, or the ISM. It
is believed that this is a result of the selective removal of refractory carbon
from primordial circumstellar material. In this work, we study the irreversible
release of carbon into the gaseous environment via photolysis and pyrolysis of
refractory carbonaceous material during the disk phase of the early Solar
System. We analytically solve the one-dimensional advection equation and derive
an explicit expression that describes the depletion of carbonaceous material in
solids under the influence of radial and vertical transport. We find both
depletion mechanisms individually fail to reproduce Solar System abundances
under typical conditions. While radial transport only marginally restricts
photodecomposition, it is the inefficient vertical transport that limits carbon
depletion under these conditions. We show explicitly that an increase in the
vertical mixing efficiency, and/or an increase in the directly irradiated disk
volume, favors carbon depletion. Thermal decomposition requires a hot inner
disk (> 500 K) beyond 3 AU to deplete the formation region of Earth and
chondrites. We find FU Ori-type outbursts to produce these conditions such that
moderately refractory compounds are depleted. However, such outbursts likely do
not deplete the most refractory carbonaceous compounds beyond the innermost
disk region. Hence, the refractory carbon abundance at 1 AU typically does not
reach terrestrial levels. Nevertheless, under specific conditions, we find
photolysis and pyrolysis combined to reproduce Solar System abundances.

"Incentivizing Gigaton-Scale Carbon Dioxide Removal via a
  Climate-Positive Blockchain","  A new crypto token is proposed as an incentive mechanism to remove CO2 from
the atmosphere permanently at gigaton scale. The token facilitates CO2 removal
(CDR) by providing financial incentives to those that are removing CO2 and an
opportunity to provide additional financial resources for CDR by the public.
The new token will be native to a blockchain that uses a Proof-of-Useful-Work
(PoUW) consensus mechanism. The useful work will be conducted by direct air
carbon capture and storage (DACCS) facilities that will compete with each other
based on the amount of CO2 captured and permanently stored. In terms of energy
consumption, we require that the entire process, comprising DACCS technology
and all blockchain operations, be climate positive while accounting for life
cycle analysis of equipment used. We describe the underlying reward mechanism
coupled with a verification mechanism for CDR. In addition, we consider
security features to limit attacks and fraudulent activity. Finally, we outline
a roadmap of features that are necessary to fully implement and deploy such a
system, but are beyond the current scope of this article.

"Towards chemically neutral carbon cleaning processes: Plasma cleaning of
  Ni, Rh, and Al reflective optical coatings and thin Al filters for Free
  Electron Lasers and synchrotron beamline applications","  The choice of a reflective optical coating or filter material has to be
adapted to the intended field of application. This is mainly determined by the
required photon energy range or by the required reflection angle. Among various
materials, nickel and rhodium are standard materials used as reflective
coatings for synchrotron mirrors. Conversely, Aluminum is one of the most
commonly used materials for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray filters.
However, both of these types of optics are subject to carbon contamination,
being increasingly problematic for the operation of the high-performance free
electron laser (FEL) and synchrotron beamlines. For this reason, an inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) source has been used in conjunction with N2/O2/H2 and
N2/H2 feedstock gas plasmas. Results from the chemical surface analysis of the
above materials before and after plasma treatment using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) are reported. We conclude that a favorable combination of an
N2/H2 plasma feedstock gas mixture leads to the best chemical surface
preservation of Ni, Rh, and Al while removing the carbon contaminations.
However, this feedstock gas mixture does not remove C contaminations as rapidly
as, e.g., a N2/O2/H2 plasma which induces the surface formation of NiO and
NiOOH in Ni and RhOOH in Rh foils. As an applied case, we demonstrate the
successful carbon removal from ultrathin Al filters previously used at the
FERMI FEL1 using a N2/H2 plasma.

Radiation resistant LGAD design,"  In this paper, we report on the radiation resistance of 50-micron thick LGAD
detectors manufactured at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler employing several
different doping combinations of the gain layer. LGAD detectors with gain layer
doping of Boron, Boron low-diffusion, Gallium, Carbonated Boron and Carbonated
Gallium have been designed and successfully produced. These sensors have been
exposed to neutron fluences up to $\phi_n \sim 3 \cdot 10^{16}\; n/cm^2$ and to
proton fluences up to $\phi_p \sim 9\cdot10^{15}\; p/cm^2$ to test their
radiation resistance. The experimental results show that Gallium-doped LGADs
are more heavily affected by initial acceptor removal than Boron-doped LGAD,
while the presence of Carbon reduces initial acceptor removal both for Gallium
and Boron doping. Boron low-diffusion shows a higher radiation resistance than
that of standard Boron implant, indicating a dependence of the initial acceptor
removal mechanism upon the implant width. This study also demonstrates that
proton irradiation is at least twice more effective in producing initial
acceptor removal, making proton irradiation far more damaging than neutron
irradiation.

Windowed Carbon Nanotubes for Efficient CO2 Removal from Natural Gas,"  We demonstrate from molecular dynamics simulations that windowed carbon
nanotubes can efficiently separate CO2 from the CO2/CH4 mixture, resembling
polymeric hollow fibers for gas separation. Three CO2/CH4 mixtures with 30%,
50% and 80% CO2 are investigated as a function of applied pressure from 80 to
180 bar. In all simulated conditions, only CO2 permeation is observed; CH4 is
completely rejected by the nitrogen-functionalized windows or pores on the
nanotube wall in the accessible timescale, while maintaining a fast diffusion
rate along the tube. The estimated time-dependent CO2 permeance ranges from 107
to 105 GPU (gas permeation unit), compared with ~100 GPU for typical polymeric
membranes. CO2/CH4 selectivity is estimated to be ~108 from the difference in
free-energy barriers of permeation. This work suggests that a windowed carbon
nanotube can be used as a highly efficient medium, configurable in
hollow-fiber-like modules, for removing CO2 from natural gas.

Stability of multivacancies in graphene,"  The stability of graphene multivacancy systems is studied using Density
Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. This work describes the evolution of the
energy of formation per carbon atom for zigzag and armchair complementary
figures -i.e. the figure formed by the carbon atoms extracted from graphene to
form the vacancy-. Multivacancy systems formed when armchair complementary
figures are removed are more stable for higher orders (>5) in comparison with
the zigzag ones. The case of the construction of a 6-order vacancy from a
5-order one (branch-like) is discussed with the dependence on the place where
the extra carbon atom is removed from graphene. The stability of multivacancy
systems could be explained through the relative positions of the pentagonal
rings present in the resulting defected graphene structure, as the more
relevant factor. Other secondary factors that affect the stability of a
graphene multivacancy system are the dangling bonds magnetic arrangements and
their steric hindrance.

Oxidation of graphene on metals,"  We use low-energy electron microscopy to investigate how graphene is removed
from Ru(0001) and Ir(111) by reaction with oxygen. We find two mechanisms on
Ru(0001). At short times, oxygen reacts with carbon monomers on the surrounding
Ru surface, decreasing their concentration below the equilibrium value. This
undersaturation causes a flux of carbon from graphene to the monomer gas. In
this initial mechanism, graphene is etched at a rate that is given precisely by
the same non-linear dependence on carbon monomer concentration that governs
growth. Thus, during both growth and etching, carbon attaches and detaches to
graphene as clusters of several carbon atoms. At later times, etching
accelerates. We present evidence that this process involves intercalated
oxygen, which destabilizes graphene. On Ir, this mechanism creates observable
holes. It also occurs mostly quickly near wrinkles in the graphene islands,
depends on the orientation of the graphene with respect to the Ir substrate,
and, in contrast to the first mechanism, can increase the density of carbon
monomers. We also observe that both layers of bilayer graphene islands on Ir
etch together, not sequentially.

"One- and two-neutron removal reactions from the most neutron-rich carbon
  isotopes","  The structure of $^{19,20,22}$C has been investigated using high-energy
(about 240 MeV/nucleon) one- and two-neutron removal reactions on a carbon
target. Measurements were made of the inclusive cross sections and momentum
distributions for the charged residues. Narrow momentum distributions were
observed for one-neutron removal from $^{19}$C and $^{20}$C and two-neutron
removal from $^{22}$C. Two-neutron removal from $^{20}$C resulted in a
relatively broad momentum distribution. The results are compared with
eikonal-model calculations combined with shell-model structure information. The
neutron-removal cross sections and associated momentum distributions are
calculated for transitions to both the particle-bound and particle-unbound
final states. The calculations take into account the population of the mass
$A-1$ reaction residues, $^{A-1}$C, and, following one-neutron emission after
one-neutron removal, the mass $A-2$ two-neutron removal residues, $^{A-2}$C.
The smaller contributions of direct two-neutron removal, that populate the
$^{A-2}$C residues in a single step, are also computed. The data and
calculations are shown to be in good overall agreement and consistent with the
predicted shell-model ground state configurations and the one-neutron overlaps
with low-lying states in $^{18-21}$C. These suggest significant
$\nu{s}_{1/2}^2$ valence neutron configurations in both $^{20}$C and $^{22}$C.
The results for $^{22}$C strongly support the picture of $^{22}$C as a

"REME -- Renewable Energy and Materials Economy -- The Path to Energy
  Security, Prosperity and Climate Stability","  A Renewable Energy and Materials Economy (REME) is proposed as the solution
to the climate change threat. REME mimics nature to produce carbon neutral
liquid fuels and chemicals as well as carbon negative materials by using water,
CO$_2$ from the atmosphere and renewable energy as inputs. By being in harmony
with nature REME has a positive feedback between economic development and
climate change protection. In REME the feedback driven accelerated rate of
economic growth enables the climate change threat to be addressed in a timely
manner. It is also cost-effective protection because it sequesters by
monetizing the carbon removed from the air in carbon-based building materials.
Thus, addressing the climate change threat is not a cost to the economy but a
result of REME driven prosperity.

"Universal map of gas-dependent kinetic selectivity in carbon nanotube
  growth","  Single-walled carbon nanotubes have been a candidate for outperforming
silicon in ultrascaled transistors, but the realization of nanotube-based
integrated circuits requires dense arrays of purely semiconducting species.
Control over kinetics and thermodynamics in tube-catalyst systems plays a key
role for direct growth of such nanotube arrays, and further progress requires
the comprehensive understanding of seemingly contradictory reports on the
growth kinetics. Here, we propose a universal kinetic model and provide its
quantitative verification by ethanol-based isotope labeling experiments. While
the removal of carbon from catalysts dominates the growth kinetics under a low
supply of precursors, our kinetic model and experiments demonstrate that
chirality-dependent growth rates emerge when sufficient amounts of carbon and
etching agents are co-supplied. As the model can be extended to create kinetic
maps as a function of gas compositions, our findings resolve discrepancies in
literature and offer rational strategies for chirality selective growth for
practical applications.

Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Sample Purification,"  Removal of impurities and aggregates from as-grown single walled-carbon
nanotube (SWCNT) materials remains an important challenge in nanotube research
and applications. We report a simple but effective purification method that
uses permanent magnets to remove nanotube aggregates, as well as residual
metallic catalyst, from surfactant-coated aqueous SWCNT suspensions. Samples
have been characterized by optical absorption, fluorescence and Raman
spectroscopies; AFM and near-IR fluorescence microscopies; and TGA. We found
that magnetic purification gives samples with reduced absorption backgrounds
and high fluorescence efficiencies comparable to those prepared by
ultracentrifugation. Nanotubes in magnetically processed HiPco samples are at
least 80% individualized. We propose that SWCNT aggregates are preferentially
removed because they contain disproportionate amounts of ferromagnetic catalyst
particles. As compared to ultracentrifugation, magnetic processing offers major
advantages in cost, simplicity, energy consumption, and scalability.

Mass transfer from a fluid flowing through a porous media,"  A mathematical model is developed for the process of mass transfer from a
fluid flowing through a packed column. Mass loss, whether by absorption or
adsorption, may be significant. This is appropriate for example when removing
contaminants from flue gases. With small mass loss the model reduces to a
simpler form which is appropriate to describe the removal of
contaminants/pollutants from liquids. A case study is carried out for the
removal of CO2 from a gas mixture passing over activated carbon. Using the
experimental parameter values it is shown, via non-dimensionalisation, that
certain terms may be neglected from the governing equations, resulting in a
form which may be solved analytically using a travelling wave substitution.
From this all important quantities throughout the column may be described;
concentration of gaseous materials, amount of material available for mass
transfer, fluid velocity and pressure. Results are verified by comparison with
experimental data for the breakthrough curve (the amount of carbon measured at
the column outlet). The advantage of the analytical expression over a purely
numerical solution is that it can easily be used to optimise the process. In
the final section we demonstrate how the model may be further reduced when
small amounts of contaminant are removed. The model is shown to exhibit better
agreement than established models when compared to experimental data for the
removal of amoxicillin and congo red dye from water.

"Theory of water desalination by porous electrodes with fixed chemical
  charge","  Water desalination by capacitive deionization (CDI) is performed via
electrochemical cells consisting of two porous carbon electrodes. Upon
transferring charge from one electrode to the other, ions are removed from the
feedwater by electrosorption into electrical double layers (EDLs) within the
micropores of the porous carbon. When using electrodes containing fixed
chemical charge in the micropores, various counterintuitive observations have
been made, such as ""inverted CDI"" where upon charging, ions are released from
the electrode, and the feedwater is only desalinated when the cell is
discharging. We set up an EDL model including chemical charge that explains

desalination by CDI.

"Kondo effect due to a hydrogen impurity in graphene: a multichannel
  Kondo problem with diverging hybridization","  We consider the Kondo effect arising from a hydrogen impurity in graphene. As
a first approximation, the strong covalent bond to a carbon atom removes that
carbon atom without breaking the $C_{3}$ rotation symmetry, and we only retain
the Hubbard interaction on the three nearest neighbors of the removed carbon
atom which then behave as magnetic impurities. These three impurity spins are
coupled to three conduction channels with definite helicity, two of which
support a diverging local density of states (LDOS) $\propto 1/ [ | \omega \ |
\ln ^{2}( \Lambda /| \omega \ | \ ) \ ] $ near the Dirac point $\omega
\rightarrow 0$ even though the bulk density of states vanishes linearly. We
study the resulting 3-impurity multi-channel Kondo model using the numerical
renormalization group method. For weak potential scattering, the ground state
of the Kondo model is a particle-hole symmetric spin-$1/2$ doublet, with
ferromagnetic coupling between the three impurity spins; for moderate potential
scattering, the ground state becomes a particle-hole asymmetric spin singlet,
with antiferromagnetic coupling between the three impurity spins. This behavior
is inherited by the Anderson model containing the hydrogen impurity and all
four carbon atoms in its vicinity.

The surprisingly low carbon mass in the debris disk around HD 32297,"  Gas has been detected in a number of debris disks. It is likely secondary,
i.e. produced by colliding solids. Here, we report ALMA Band 8 observations of
neutral carbon in the CO-rich debris disk around the 15--30 Myr old A-type star
HD 32297. We find that C$^0$ is located in a ring at $\sim$110 au with a FWHM
of $\sim$80 au, and has a mass of $(3.5\pm0.2)\times10^{-3}$ M$_\oplus$.
Naively, such a surprisingly small mass can be accumulated from CO
photo-dissociation in a time as short as $\sim$10$^4$ yr. We develop a simple
model for gas production and destruction in this system, properly accounting
for CO self-shielding and shielding by neutral carbon, and introducing a
removal mechanism for carbon gas. We find that the most likely scenario to
explain both C$^0$ and CO observations, is one where the carbon gas is rapidly
removed on a timescale of order a thousand years and the system maintains a
very high CO production rate of $\sim$15 M$_\oplus$ Myr$^{-1}$, much higher
than the rate of dust grind-down. We propose a possible scenario to meet these
peculiar conditions: the capture of carbon onto dust grains, followed by rapid
CO re-formation and re-release. In steady state, CO would continuously be
recycled, producing a CO-rich gas ring that shows no appreciable spreading over
time. This picture might be extended to explain other gas-rich debris disks.

"From prosumer to flexumer: Case study on the value of flexibility in
  decarbonizing the multi-energy system of a manufacturing company","  Digitalization and sector coupling enable companies to turn into flexumers.
By using the flexibility of their multi-energy system (MES), they reduce costs
and carbon emissions while stabilizing the electricity system. However, to
identify the necessary investments in energy conversion and storage
technologies to leverage demand response (DR) potentials, companies need to
assess the value of flexibility. Therefore, this study quantifies the
flexibility value of a production company's MES by optimizing the synthesis,
design, and operation of a decarbonizing MES considering self-consumption
optimization, peak shaving, and integrated DR based on hourly prices and carbon
emission factors (CEFs). The detailed case study of a beverage company in
northern Germany considers vehicle-to-X of powered industrial trucks,
power-to-heat on multiple temperatures, wind turbines, photovoltaic systems,
and energy storage systems (thermal energy, electricity, and hydrogen). We
propose and apply novel data-driven metrics to evaluate the intensity of
price-based and CEF-based DR. The results reveal that flexibility usage reduces
decarbonization costs (by 19-80% depending on electricity and carbon removal
prices), total annual costs, operating carbon emissions, energy-weighted
average prices and CEFs, and fossil energy dependency. The results also suggest
that a net-zero operational carbon emission MES requires flexibility, which, in
an economic case, is provided by a combination of different flexible
technologies and storage systems that complement each other. While the value of
flexibility depends on various market and consumer-specific factors such as
electricity or carbon removal prices, this study highlights the importance of
demand flexibility for the decarbonization of MESs.

"First-principles study of configurational disorder in B$_{4}$C using a
  superatom-special quasirandom structure method","  Configurationally disordered crystalline boron carbide, B$_{4}$C, is studied
using first-principles calculations. We investigate both dilute and high
concentrations of carbon-boron substitutional defects. For the latter purpose,
we suggest a superatom's picture of the complex structure and combine it with a
special quasi-random structure approach for disorder. In this way, we model a
random distribution of high concentrations of the identified low-energy
defects: 1) Bipolar defects and 2) Rotation of icosahedral carbon among the
three polar-up sites. Additionally, the substitutional disorder of the
icosahedral carbon at all six polar sites, as previously discussed in the
literature, is also considered. Two configurational phase transitions from the
ordered to the disordered configurations are predicted to take place upon
increasing temperature using a mean-field approximation for the entropy. The
first transition, at 870 K, induces substitutional disorder of the icosahedral
carbon atoms among the three polar-up sites, meanwhile the second transition,
at 2325 K, reveals the random substitution of the icosahedral carbon atoms at
all six polar sites coexisting with bipolar defects. Already the first
transition removes the monoclinic distortion existing in the ordered ground
state configuration and restore the rhombohedral system (R3m). The restoration
of inversion symmetry yielding the full rhombohedral symmetry (R-3m) on
average, corresponding to what is reported in the literature, is achieved after
the second transition. The electronic density of states, obtained from the
disordered phases indicates a sensitivity of band gap to the degree of
configurational disorder in B$_{4}$C.

Effects of Langmuir Turbulence on Upper Ocean Carbonate Chemistry,"  Effects of wave-driven Langmuir turbulence on the air-sea flux of carbon
dioxide (CO$_2$) are examined using large eddy simulations featuring actively
reacting carbonate chemistry in the ocean mixed layer at small scales. Four
strengths of Langmuir turbulence are examined with three types of carbonate
chemistry: time-dependent, instantaneous equilibrium chemistry, and no
reactions. The time-dependent model is obtained by reducing a detailed
eight-species chemical mechanism using computational singular perturbation
analysis, resulting in a quasi-steady-state approximation for hydrogen ion
(H$^+$), i.e., fixed pH. The reduced mechanism is then integrated in two
half-time steps before and after the advection solve using a
Runge--Kutta--Chebyshev scheme that is robust for stiff systems of differential
equations. The simulations show that, as the strength of Langmuir turbulence
increases, CO$_2$ fluxes are enhanced by rapid overturning of the near-surface
layer, which rivals the removal rate of CO$_2$ by time-dependent reactions.
Equilibrium chemistry and non-reactive models are found to bring more and less
carbon, respectively, into the ocean as compared to the more realistic
time-dependent model. These results have implications for Earth system models
that either neglect Langmuir turbulence or use equilibrium, instead of
time-dependent, chemical mechanisms.

"Native point defects and carbon clusters in 4H-SiC: A hybrid functional
  study","  We report first-principles calculations that clarify the formation energies
and charge transition levels of native point defects and carbon clusters in the
4H polytype of silicon carbide (4H-SiC) under a carbon-rich condition. We
applied a hybrid functional that reproduces the experimental bandgap of SiC
well and offers reliable defect properties. For point defects, we investigated
single vacancies, antisites, and interstitials of Si and C on relevant sites.
For carbon clusters, we systematically introduced two additional C atoms into
the perfect 4H-SiC lattice with and without removing Si atoms and performed
structural optimization to identify stable defect configurations. We found that
neutral Si antisites are energetically favorable among Si-point defects in a
wide range of the Fermi level position around the intrinsic regime, whereas
negatively-charged Si vacancies and a positively-charged Si interstitial on a
site surrounded by three Si and three C atoms become favorable under n- and
p-type conditions, respectively. For C-point defects, neutral C antisites are
favorable under intrinsic and n-type conditions, whereas positively-charged C
vacancies become favorable under p-type conditions. We also found that a
di-carbon antisite is more favorable than a C-split interstitial, which is the
most stable form of single C interstitials.

Carbon cycling and habitability of massive Earth-like exoplanets,"  As the number of detected rocky extrasolar planets increases, the question of
whether their surfaces could be habitable is becoming more pertinent. On Earth,
the long-term carbonate silicate cycle is able to regulate surface temperatures
over timescales larger than one million years. Elevated temperatures enhance
weathering, removing CO$_2$ from the atmosphere, which is subducted into the
mantle. At mid-ocean ridges, CO$_2$ is supplied to the atmosphere from the
interior. The carbon degassing flux is controlled by the melting depth beneath
mid-ocean ridges and the spreading rate, influenced by the pressure- and
temperature-dependent mantle viscosity. The influences of temperature and
pressure on mantle degassing become increasingly important for more massive
planets. Here, we couple a thermal evolution model of Earth-like planets of
different masses with a model of the long-term carbon cycle and assess their
surface temperature evolution. We find that the spreading rate at 4.5 Gyr
increases with planetary mass up to 3 $M_\oplus$, since the
temperature-dependence of viscosity dominates over its pressure-dependency. For
higher mass planets, pressure-dependence dominates and the plates slow down. In
addition, the effective melting depth at 4.5 Gyr as a function of planetary
mass has its maximum at 3 $M_\oplus$. Altogether, at 4.5 Gyr, the degassing
rate and therefore surface temperature have their maximum at 3 $M_\oplus$. This
work emphasizes that both age and mass should be considered when predicting the
habitability of exoplanets. Despite these effects, the long-term carbon cycle
remains an effective mechanism that regulates the surface temperature of
massive Earth-like planets.

Covalent atomic bonds in graphene layers are described using a Brenner

For interlayer interactions a registry-dependent potential with local normals
is used. The behavior of the system is investigated under conditions of
different magnitudes of tip-sample interaction and indentation rates. Strong
forces between the nanoasperity and carbon atoms facilitate the cleavage of the
graphite surface. Exfoliation, i. e. total removal of the upper graphitic

Energetics and stability of vacancies in carbon nanotubes,"  In this work we present ab initio calculations of the formation energies and
stability of different types of multi-vacancies in carbon nanotubes. We
demonstrate that, as in the case of graphene, the reconstruction of the defects
has drastic effects on the energetics of the tubes. In particular, the
formation of pentagons eliminates the dangling bonds thus lowering the
formation energy. This competition leads to vacancies having an even number of
carbon atoms removed to be more stable. Finally the appearance of magic numbers
indicating more stable defects can be represented by a model for the formation
energies that is based on the number of dangling bonds of the unreconstructed

along an armchair or along a zig-zag direction. Removing the energetic
contribution of bending angles, using a previously introduced angle bending
potential, we isolate the purely torsional deformation energy, which is then
fitted to simple torsional force fields. The presented out-of-plane torsional
potential can accurately fit the deformation energy for relatively large
torsional angles up to 0.5 rad. To test our proposed potential, we apply it to
the problem of the vertical displacement of a single carbon atom out of the
graphene plane and compare the obtained deformation energy with corresponding
DFT calculations. The dependence of the deformation energy on the vertical
displacement of the pulled carbon atom is indistinguishable in these two cases,
for displacements up to about 0.5 $\AA$. The presented potential is applicable
to other sp$^2$ carbon structures.

"Graphane with carbon dimer defects: Robust in-gap states and a scalable
  two-dimensional platform for quantum computation","  We study the energy level structures of the defective graphane lattice, where
a carbon dimer defect is created by removing the hydrogen atoms on two
nearest-neighbor carbon sites. Robust defect states emerge inside the bulk
insulating gap of graphane. While for the stoichiometric half-filled system
there are two doubly degenerate defect levels, there are four nondegenerate and
spin-polarized in-gap defect levels in the system with one electron less than
half filling. A universal set of quantum gates can be realized in the defective
graphane lattice, by triggering resonant transitions among the defect states
via optical pulses and \emph{ac} magnetic fields. The sizable energy separation
between the occupied and the empty in-gap states enables precise control at
room temperature. The spatial locality of the in-gap states implies a qubit
network of extremely high areal density. Based on these results, we propose
that graphane as a unique platform could be used to construct the future
all-purpose quantum computers.

many years in the field of ISOL method. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the

Fourteen UCx samples were synthetized from different uranium and carbon sources
using three mixing protocols. All carburized samples were systematically
characterized in terms of nature and proportion phases, grain and aggregate
size, open and close porosity proportion and open pore size distribution. Our
results were analysed using a multivariate statistical approach in order to
remove any subjective bias. Strong correlations between the physicochemical
characteristics of the samples as well as the impact of the synthesis process

combined with a new method of mixing is the key parameter to limit the
sintering and to obtain samples with small grains and a high porosity well
distributed over small pores. Moreover the microstructure obtained proved to be
stable at high temperature.

Discovering Effective Policies for Land-Use Planning with Neuroevolution,"  How areas of land are allocated for different uses, such as forests, urban
areas, and agriculture, has a large effect on the terrestrial carbon balance,
and therefore climate change. Based on available historical data on land-use
changes and a simulation of the associated carbon emissions and removals, a
surrogate model can be learned that makes it possible to evaluate the different
options available to decision-makers efficiently. An evolutionary search
process can then be used to discover effective land-use policies for specific
locations. Such a system was built on the Project Resilience platform and
evaluated with the Land-Use Harmonization dataset LUH2 and the bookkeeping
model BLUE. It generates Pareto fronts that trade off carbon impact and amount
of land-use change customized to different locations, thus providing a
potentially useful tool for land-use planning.

results show how phase lags (asynchronous changes from stimuli) and parameter
similarities can illuminate the sequence of structural changes in materials,
providing insights into phenomena like the removal of amorphous carbon and

"Thermodynamic Analysis of Titanium Removal from Molten iron Smelted with
  Large Amounts of Sodium Additives","  High purity iron is obtained from vanadium-titanium magnetite (VTM) by
one-step coal-based direct reduction-smelting process with coal as reductant
and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) as additives. Industrial experiments show that
the process of treating molten iron with a large amount of Na2CO3 is effective
in removing titanium from molten iron. However, the studies are rarely
conducted in thermodynamic relationship between titanium and other components
of molten iron, under the condition of a large amount of Na2CO3 additives. In
this study, through the thermodynamic database software Factsage8.0, the
effects of melting temperature, sodium content and oxygen content on the
removal of titanium from molten iron are studied. The results of thermodynamic
calculation show that the removal of titanium from molten iron needs to be
under the condition of oxidation, and the temperature should be below the
critical temperature of titanium removal (the highest temperature at which
titanium can be removed). Relatively low temperature and high oxygen content
contribute to the removal of titanium from molten iron. The high oxygen content
is conducive to the simultaneous removal of titanium and phosphorus from molten
iron. In addition, from a thermodynamic point of view, excessive sodium
addition inhibits the removal of titanium from molten iron.

"Nitrate removal from water using electrostatic regeneration of
  functionalized adsorbent","  Nitrate is an important pollutant in drinking water worldwide, and a number
of methods exist for the removal of nitrate from water including ion exchange
and reverse osmosis. However, these approaches suffer from a variety of
disadvantages including requirements for supply and disposal of brine used for
regeneration in ion exchange and low water recovery ratio for reverse osmosis.
Here, we demonstrate the use of high surface area activated carbon electrodes
functionalized with moieties having high affinity for adsorption of nitrate
from aqueous solution, such as those used in ion exchange. Adsorption of
surfactant molecules having a quaternary amine ionic group to the activated
carbon surfaces provides functionalization of the surfaces without complex
chemistries. The functionalized electrodes have adsorption capacities of about
80 mg NaNO$_3$ per gram of activated carbon material. Unlike a traditional ion
exchanger, the functionalized surfaces can be repeatedly regenerated by the
application of an electrostatic potential which displaces the bound NO$_3^-$
while leaving an excess of electronic charge on the electrode. The cell is
completed by an inert counter electrode where Faradaic reactions occur during
regeneration. Up to approximately 40% of the initial capacity of the electrode
is accessible following electrical regeneration.

atmospheric pressure microplasma jets with admixture of Hexamethyldisiloxane
(HMDSO) and oxygen and the role of surface reactions in film growth are
investigated. Two types of microplasma jets, one with a planar electrodes and
operated in helium gas and the other one with a coaxial geometry operated in

and the carbon-content in the film are measured as a function of the O$_2$ and
HMDSO admixture in the planar jet and are compared to mass spectrometry
measurements of the consumption of HMDSO. Additionally, the localized nature of
the jet-substrate interaction is utilized to study surface reactions by
applying two jets on a rotating substrate. The addition of oxygen into the gas
mixture increases HMDSO depletion and the growth rate and results in the
deposition of carbon free films. The surface reaction is responsible for the
carbon removal from the growing film. Moreover, carbon free films can be
deposited even without addition of oxygen, when coaxial jet operated with argon
is used for the surface treatment. We hypothesize that ions or excited species

"Compensation effect in carbon nanotube quantum dots coupled to polarized
  electrodes in the presence of spin-orbit coupling","  We study theoretically the Kondo effect in carbon nanotube quantum dot
attached to polarized electrodes. Since both spin and orbit degrees of freedom
are involved in such a system, the electrode polarization contains the spin-
and orbit-polarizations as well as the Kramers polarization in the presence of
the spin-orbit coupling. In this paper we focus on the compensation effect of
the effective fields induced by different polarizations by applying magnetic
field. The main results are i) while the effective fields induced by the spin-
and orbit-polarizations remove the degeneracy in the Kondo effect, the
effective field induced by the Kramers polarization enhances the degeneracy
through suppressing the spin-orbit coupling; ii) while the effective field
induced by the spin-polarization can not be compensated by applying magnetic
field, the effective field induced by the orbit-polarization can be
compensated; and iii) the presence of the spin-orbit coupling does not change
the compensation behavior observed in the case without the spin-orbit coupling.
These results are observable in an ultraclean carbon-nanotube quantum dot

"Convection Destroys the Core/Mantle Structure in Hybrid C/O/Ne White
  Dwarfs","  A hybrid C/O/Ne white dwarf (WD) -- an unburned C/O core surrounded by an
O/Ne/Na mantle -- can be formed if the carbon flame is quenched in a super-AGB
(SAGB) star or white dwarf merger remnant. We show that this segregated hybrid
structure becomes unstable to rapid mixing within 2,000 years of the onset of
WD cooling. Carbon burning includes a weak reaction that removes electrons,
resulting in a lower electron-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{\rm e}$) in the regions
processed by carbon burning compared to the unburned C/O core, making the O/Ne
mantle denser than the C/O core as the WD cools. This is unstable to efficient
mixing. We use the results of $\texttt{MESA}$ models with different size C/O
cores to quantify the rate at which the cores mix with the mantle as they cool.
In all cases, we find that the WDs undergo significant core/mantle mixing on
timescales shorter than the time available to grow the WD to the Chandrasekhar
mass ($M_{\rm Ch}$) by accretion. As a result, hybrid WDs that reach $M_{\rm
Ch}$ due to later accretion will have lower central carbon fractions than
assumed thus far. We briefly discuss the implications of these results for the
possibility of Type Ia supernovae from hybrid WDs.

"Evaluation of reduced-graphene-oxide-supported gold nanoparticles as
  catalytic system for electroreduction of oxygen in alkaline electrolyte","  Chemically-reduced graphene-oxide-supported gold nanoparticles are considered
here as catalytic materials for the reduction of oxygen in alkaline medium.
Gold nanoparticles are prepared by the chemical reduction method, in which the
NaBH4-prereduced Keggin-type phosphomolybdate heteropolyblue acts as the
reducing agent for the precursor (HAuCl4). Polyoxmetallate (PMo12O403-) capping
ligands stabilize gold nanoparticle deposits, facilitate their dispersion and
attachment to carbon supports. Indeed, it is apparent from the independent
diagnostic voltammetric experiments (in 0.5 mol dm-3 H2SO4) that
heteropolymolybdates form readily stable adsorbates on nanostructures of both
gold and carbon (reduced graphene oxide and Vulcan). It is reasonable to expect
that the polyoxometallate-assisted nucleation of gold has occurred in the
proximity of oxygenated defects existing on carbon substrates. Under conditions
of electrochemical diagnostic experiments (performed in 0.1 mol dm-3 KOH): (i)
the phosphomolybdate adsorbates are removed from the interface as they undergo
dissolution in alkaline medium; and (ii) the Au nanoparticles (Au loading, 30
{\mu}g cm-2) remain well-dispersed on the carbon as evident from transmission
electron microscopy. High electrocatalytic activity of the reduced-graphene
oxide-supported Au nanoparticles toward reduction of oxygen in alkaline medium
is demonstrated using cyclic and rotating ring-disk voltammetric experiments.
Among important issues are possible activating interactions between gold and
the support, as well as presence of structural defects existing on poorly
organized graphitic structure of reduced graphene oxide (as evident from Raman
spectroscopy).

"Comparison of Algorithms for Baseline Correction of LIBS Spectra for
  Quantifying Total Carbon in Brazilian Soils","  LIBS (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) is a versatile technique for
multi-element analysis, offering rapid analysis with minimal sample
preparation. However, challenges persist in baseline correction due to
background radiation, causing non-linear interference with emission lines. This
necessitates proper baseline correction for accurate quantification of elements
in LIBS spectra. Our study focuses on the quantification of total carbon in
soil samples, conducting a comparative analysis of filters and methods for
noise removal and baseline correction in LIBS spectra. We exhaustively tested
all combinations of filters and methods, optimizing their parameters to
establish the strongest correlation between corrected spectra and carbon
content in a training sample set. We then evaluated these combinations using
optimized parameters on a separate test sample set. Through rigorous
evaluation, we found that the combination of the Savitzky-Golay filter and the
4S Peak Filling method achieved the most effective baseline correction. This
combination demonstrated a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.93 and a root
mean square error of 0.21. Notably, it outperformed a linear regression model
based solely on the carbon emission line at 193.04 nm, which yielded a
correlation of 0.91 with a root mean square error of 0.26. Our proposed
procedure presents a novel approach for baseline correction in LIBS spectra,

of iron and nitrogen in a carbon matrix (Fe-N-C) are a promising alternative to
platinum group metal (PGM) based catalysts in polymer electrolyte membrane
(PEM) fuel cells. Further improvements of Fe-N-C catalysts would benefit from
model thin film studies of activity and stability of catalytic sites, but
synthesis of Fe-N-C model thin films is challenging. Here we report on

the thin Fe-N-C films is greater for both high-temperature samples than for the
room-temperature sample. From the analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy

"Conversion pathways of primary defects by annealing in proton-irradiated
  n-type 4H-SiC","  The development of defect populations after proton irradiation of n-type
4H-SiC and subsequent annealing experiments is studied by means of deep level
transient (DLTS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. A comprehensive model
is suggested describing the evolution and interconversion of
irradiation-induced point defects during annealing below 1000{\deg}C. The model
proposes the EH4 and EH5 traps frequently found by DLTS to originate from the
(+/0) charge transition level belonging to different configurations of the
carbon antisite-carbon vacancy (CAV) complex. Furthermore, we show that the
transformation channel between the silicon vacancy (VSi) and CAV is effectively
blocked under n-type conditions, but becomes available in samples where the
Fermi level has moved towards the center of the band gap due to
irradiation-induced donor compensation. The annealing of VSi and the carbon
vacancy (VC) is shown to be dominated by recombination with residual
self-interstitials at temperatures of up to 400{\deg}C. Going to higher
temperatures, a decay of the CAV pair density is reported which is closely
correlated to a renewed increase of VC concentration. A conceivable explanation
for this process is the dissociation of the CAV pair into separate carbon
anitisites and VC defects. Lastly, the presented data supports the claim that
the removal of free carriers in irradiated SiC is due to introduced
compensating defects and not passivation of shallow nitrogen donors.

Comparative analysis of carbon cycle models via kinetic representations,"  The pre-industrial state of the global carbon cycle is a significant aspect

kinetic representations of the pre-industrial models of Schmitz (2002) and
Anderies et al. (2013) from our earlier work. The power law kinetic
representations, as uniform formalism, allow for a more extensive analysis and
comparison of the different models for the same system. Using the mathematical
theories of chemical reaction networks (with power-law kinetics), this work
extends the analysis of the kinetic representations of the two models and
assesses the similarities and differences in their structural and dynamic
properties in relation to model construction assumptions. The analysis includes
but is not limited to the coincidence of kinetic and stoichiometric spaces of
the networks, capacity for equilibria multiplicity and co-multiplicity, and
absolute concentration robustness in some species. Moreover, we bring together
previously published results about the power law kinetic representations of the
two models and consolidate them with new observations here. We also illustrate
how the pre-industrial model of Anderies et al. may serve as a building block

"Geophysical inversions to delineate rocks with CO$_2$ sequestration
  potential through carbon mineralization","  In addition to reducing anthropogenic emissions of CO$_2$, it is increasingly
clear we also need to remove CO$_2$ from the atmosphere in order to avoid some
of the worst case scenarios for climate change. Geologic sequestration of
CO$_2$ is among the most attractive approaches because of the large global
capacity and long-time scales for storage. One mechanism of geologic storage is
through carbon mineralization. Some mafic and ultramafic rocks contain minerals
that will react with CO$_2$ in a carbonation reaction and convert it to
carbonated minerals. This is effectively a permanent CO$_2$ storage mechanism.
The geologic question we are faced with is then to locate, delineate and
estimate the volume of potentially reactive rocks. Using a synthetic model that
emulates a prospective site for carbon mineralization in British Columbia, we
simulate and invert gravity and magnetic data to delineate reactive rocks. We
begin by inverting each data set independently and introduce a proxy experiment
to contend with the challenging problem of choosing an appropriate
physical-property threshold to estimate volumes from the recovered model. We
use this proxy experiment to estimate thresholds for standard, $\ell_2$
inversion of the gravity and magnetics, as well as for inversions which use
sparse and compact norms. A Petrophysically and Geologically Guided Inversion
(PGI) framework is used to construct quasi-geologic models from which volumes
can be estimated directly. We apply the PGI framework to the magnetics and
gravity data independently. The framework is also used to jointly invert these
data and produce a model that is consistent with both data sets. Cumulative
volume estimates with depth are informative and can help decide whether in situ
or ex situ sequestration might be appropriate. Using each of the inverted
models, we estimate cumulative volume of reactive rock as a function of depth.

"Automated deep reinforcement learning for real-time scheduling strategy

  captured system","  The carbon-capturing process with the aid of CO2 removal technology (CDRT)
has been recognised as an alternative and a prominent approach to deep
decarbonisation. However, the main hindrance is the enormous energy demand and
the economic implication of CDRT if not effectively managed. Hence, a novel
deep reinforcement learning agent (DRL), integrated with an automated
hyperparameter selection feature, is proposed in this study for the real-time
scheduling of a multi-energy system coupled with CDRT. Post-carbon capture
systems (PCCS) and direct-air capture systems (DACS) are considered CDRT.
Various possible configurations are evaluated using real-time multi-energy data
of a district in Arizona and CDRT parameters from manufacturers' catalogues and
pilot project documentation. The simulation results validate that an optimised
soft-actor critic (SAC) algorithm outperformed the TD3 algorithm due to its
maximum entropy feature. We then trained four (4) SAC agents, equivalent to the
number of considered case studies, using optimised hyperparameter values and
deployed them in real time for evaluation. The results show that the proposed
DRL agent can meet the prosumers' multi-energy demand and schedule the CDRT
energy demand economically without specified constraints violation. Also, the
proposed DRL agent outperformed rule-based scheduling by 23.65%. However, the
configuration with PCCS and solid-sorbent DACS is considered the most suitable
configuration with a high CO2 captured-released ratio of 38.54, low CO2
released indicator value of 2.53, and a 36.5% reduction in CDR cost due to
waste heat utilisation and high absorption capacity of the selected sorbent.
However, the adoption of CDRT is not economically viable at the current carbon
price. Finally, we showed that CDRT would be attractive at a carbon price of
400-450USD/ton with the provision of tax incentives by the policymakers.

side) with regular respirator breathing. Three mask positions, top, side, and
bottom, were evaluated under two breathing cycles (approximately 9.65s of
breathing time). The results demonstrated that adding a fan respirator
significantly decreased internal mask temperature, humidity, and CO2
concentration. The average CO2 concentration decreased by 87%, 67% and 73% for
locations bottom, top and side respectively. Whilst the top and side fan
locations enhanced the removal of the exhaled gas mixture, the bottom-fan
respirator was more efficient in removing the nostril jet gas mixture and
therefore provided the least barrier to respiratory function. The results

Impacts of peak-flow events on hyporheic denitrification potential,"  Subsurface flows, particularly hyporheic exchange fluxes, driven by streambed
topography, permeability, channel gradient and dynamic flow conditions provide
prominent ecological services such as nitrate removal from streams and
aquifers. Stream flow dynamics cause strongly nonlinear and often episodic
contributions of nutrient concentrations in river-aquifer systems. Using a
fully coupled transient flow and reactive transport model, we investigated the
denitrification potential of hyporheic zones during peak-flow events. The
effects of streambed permeability, channel gradient and bedform amplitude on
the spatio-temporal distribution of nitrate and dissolved organic carbon in
streambeds and the associated denitrification potential were explored. Distinct
peak-flow events with different intensity, duration and hydrograph shape were
selected to represent a wide range of peak-flow scenarios. Our results
indicated that the specific hydrodynamic characteristics of individual flow
events largely determine the average positive or negative nitrate removal
capacity of hyporheic zones, however the magnitude of this capacity is
controlled by geomorphological settings (i.e. channel slope, streambed
permeability and bedform amplitude). Specifically, events with longer duration
and higher intensity were shown to promote higher nitrate removal efficiency
with higher magnitude of removal efficiency in the scenarios with higher slope
and permeability values. These results are essential for better assessment of
the subsurface nitrate removal capacity under the influence of flow dynamics
and particularly peak-flow events in order to provide tailored solutions for
effective restoration of interconnected river-aquifer systems.

"Size-based ion selectivity of micropore electric double layers in
  capacitive deionization electrodes","  Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a fast-emerging technology most commonly
applied to brackish water desalination. In CDI, salt ions are removed from the
feedwater and stored in electric double layers (EDLs) within micropores of
electrically charged porous carbon electrodes. Recent experiments have
demonstrated that CDI electrodes exhibit selective ion removal based on ion
size, with the smaller ion being preferentially removed in the case of
equal-valence ions. However, state-of-the-art CDI theory does not capture this
observed selectivity, as it assumes volume-less point ions in the micropore
EDLs. We here present a theory which includes multiple couterionic species, and
relaxes the point ion assumption by incorporating ion volume exclusion
interactions into a description of the micropore EDLs. The developed model is a
coupled set of nonlinear algebraic equations which can be solved for micropore
ion concentrations and electrode Donnan potential at cell equilibrium. We
demonstrate that this model captures key features of the experimentally
observed size-based ion selectivity of CDI electrodes.

"A Cool Dust Factory in the Crab Nebula: A Herschel Study of the
  Filaments","  Whether supernovae are major sources of dust in galaxies is a long-standing
debate. We present infrared and submillimeter photometry and spectroscopy from
the Herschel Space Observatory of the Crab Nebula between 51 and 670 micron as
part of the Mass Loss from Evolved StarS program. We compare the emission
detected with Herschel with multiwavelength data including millimeter, radio,
mid-infrared and archive optical images. We carefully remove the synchrotron
component using the Herschel and Planck fluxes measured in the same epoch. The
contribution from line emission is removed using Herschel spectroscopy combined
with Infrared Space Observatory archive data. Several forbidden lines of
carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are detected where multiple velocity components are
resolved, deduced to be from the nitrogen-depleted, carbon-rich ejecta. No
spectral lines are detected in the SPIRE wavebands; in the PACS bands, the line
contribution is 5% and 10% at 70 and 100 micron and negligible at 160 micron.
After subtracting the synchrotron and line emission, the remaining far-infrared
continuum can be fit with two dust components. Assuming standard interstellar
silicates, the mass of the cooler component is 0.24(+0.32)(-0.08) Msolar for T
= 28.1(+5.5)(-3.2)K. Amorphous carbon grains require 0.11 +/- 0.01 Msolar of
dust with T = 33.8(+2.3)(-1.8) K. A single temperature modified-blackbody with
0.14Msolar and 0.08Msolar for silicate and carbon dust respectively, provides
an adequate fit to the far- infrared region of the spectral energy distribution
but is a poor fit at 24-500 micron. The Crab Nebula has condensed most of the

"Rapid fluctuation of the tensor polarization of deuteron beams behind
  carbon foils and their relation to the resonances in the isospin-breaking
  $^{12}{\rm C}(d,α_{2})^{10}{\rm B}^{*}$ reaction","  Rapid fluctuations are observed in the tensor-polarization $p_{zz}$ of
deuteron beams forward-transmitted through graphite targets. Unpolarized 9.50
to 18.60\,MeV beams from the K\""oln tandem accelerator were utilized, and the
polarization behind seven 36 to 188\,mg/cm$^{2}$ targets was measured with a
polarimeter based on the $^{3}{\rm He}(\vec{d},p)^{4}{\rm He}$ reaction. Due to
the chosen relation between the areal target densities and the initial beam
energies $E_{\rm in}$, the seven sets of $p_{zz}(E_{\rm in})$ can be combined
in a common plot as a function of $E_{\rm in}$. This allows one to understand
$p_{zz}$, measured behind the 188\,mg/cm$^{2}$ target at $E_{\rm
in}$=18.6\,MeV, as resulting from the sequence of differential polarization
production $\Delta p_{zz}(E)/\Delta E$ during energy degradation in the target
from $E$=18.60 to 9.50\,MeV. The rapid fluctuations of $\Delta p_{zz}(E)/\Delta
E$$p_{zz}$ are described by 51 Gaussian-distributed cross-sections removing
deuterons either in the $m=0$ or in the $m=\pm 1$ state from the beam. The 51
fitted central energies $E_{0}$ with a single exception agree with the energies
of the narrow peaks in the excitation functions of the weak, isospin-breaking

deuterons in the $m=0$ ($m=\pm 1$) state from the beam leads to the formation
of $^{14}$N states of established positive (negative) parity. As an
application, the removal cross-section functions allow to calculate $p_{zz}$
achievable with carbon targets for initial beam energies $E_{\rm in}$ between
18.60 and 9.50\,MeV and $E_{\rm out}$ given by the areal target density. Carbon
layers in a sandwich technique would enable $p_{zz}$ between -0.4 and +0.3.

"Initial validation of a soil-based mass-balance approach for empirical
  monitoring of enhanced rock weathering rates","  Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) is a promising scalable and cost-effective
Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategy with significant environmental and
agronomic co-benefits. A major barrier to large-scale implementation of ERW is
a robust Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework. To
successfully quantify the amount of carbon dioxide removed by ERW, MRV must be
accurate, precise, and cost-effective. Here, we outline a mass-balance-based
method where analysis of the chemical composition of soil samples is used to
track in-situ silicate rock weathering. We show that signal-to-noise issues of
in-situ soil analysis can be mitigated by using isotope-dilution mass
spectrometry to reduce analytical error. We implement a proof-of-concept
experiment demonstrating the method in controlled mesocosms. In our experiment,
basalt rock feedstock is added to soil columns containing the cereal crop
Sorghum bicolor at a rate equivalent to 50 t ha$^{-1}$. Using our approach, we
calculate rock weathering corresponding to an average initial CDR value of 1.44
+/- 0.27 tCO$_2$eq ha$^{-1}$ from our experiments after 235 days, within error
of an independent estimate calculated using conventional elemental budgeting of
reaction products. Our method provides a robust time-integrated estimate of
initial CDR, to feed into models that track and validate large-scale carbon

"Non-thermal desorption of complex organic molecules: Cosmic-ray
  sputtering of CH3OH embedded in CO2 ice","  Methanol ice is embedded in interstellar ice mantles present in dense
molecular clouds. We aim to measure the sputtering efficiencies starting from
different ice mantles of varying compositions experimentally, in order to
evaluate their potential impact on astrochemical models. The sputtering yields
of complex organic molecules is of particular interest, since few mechanisms
are efficient enough to induce a significant feedback to the gas phase. We
irradiated methanol and carbon dioxide ice mixtures of varying ratios with
swift heavy ions in the electronic sputtering regime. We monitored the
evolution of the infrared spectra and the species released to the gas phase
with a mass spectrometer. Methanol and 13C-methanol isotopologue were used to
remove any ambiguity on the measured irradiation products. The sputtering of
methanol embedded in carbon dioxide ice is an efficient process leading to the
ejection of intact methanol in the gas phase. We establish that when methanol
is embedded in a carbon-dioxide-rich mantle exposed to cosmic rays, a
significant fraction is sputtered as intact molecules. The sputtered fraction
follows the time-dependent bulk composition of the ice mantle, the latter
evolving with time due to the radiolysis-induced evolution of the bulk. If
methanol is embedded in a carbon dioxide ice matrix, as the analyses of the
spectral shape of the CO2 bending mode observations in some lines of sight
suggest, the overall methanol sputtering yield is higher than if embedded in a
water ice mantle. The sputtering is increased by a factor close to the dominant
ice matrix sputtering yield, which is about six times higher for pure carbon
dioxide ice when compared to water ice. These experiments are further
constraining the cosmic-ray-induced ice mantle sputtering mechanisms important
role in the gas-phase release of complex organic molecules from the
interstellar solid phase.

"Metallic Carbon Nanotube Quantum Dots with Broken Symmetries as a
  Platform for Tunable Terahertz Detection","  Generating and detecting radiation in the technologically relevant range of
the so-called terahertz gap ($0.1 - 10$ THz) is challenging because of a lack
of efficient sources and detectors. Quantum dots in carbon nanotubes have shown
great potential to build sensitive terahertz detectors usually based on
photon-assisted tunnelling. A recently reported mechanism combining resonant
quantum dot transitions and tunnelling barriers asymmetries results in a narrow
linewidth photocurrent response with a large signal-to-noise ratio under weak
THz radiation. That device was sensitive to one frequency, corresponding to
transitions between equidistant quantized states. In this work we show, using
numerical together with scanning tunnelling spectroscopy studies of a
defect-induced metallic zigzag single-walled carbon nanotube quantum dot that
simultaneously breaking various symmetries in metallic nanotube quantum dots of
arbitrary chirality strongly relaxes the selection rules in the electric dipole
approximation, and removes energy degeneracies. This leads to a richer set of
allowed optical transitions spanning frequencies from 1 THz to several tens of
THz, for a $\sim$10 nm quantum dot. Based on these findings, we propose a
terahertz detector device based on a metallic single-walled carbon nanotube
quantum dot defined by artificial defects. Depending on its length and contacts
transparency, the operating regimes range from a high-resolution gate-tunable
terahertz sensor to a broadband terahertz detector. Our calculations indicate
that the device is largely unaffected by temperatures up to 100 K, making
carbon nanotube quantum dots with broken symmetries a promising platform to
design tunable terahertz detectors that could operate at liquid nitrogen
temperatures.

"Are biofuel mandates cost-effective? -- an analysis of transport fuels
  and biomass usage to achieve emissions targets in the European energy system","  Abatement options for the hard-to-electrify parts of the transport sector are
needed to achieve ambitious emissions targets. Biofuels based on biomass,
electrofuels based on renewable hydrogen and a carbon source, as well as fossil
fuels compensated by carbon dioxide removal (CDR) are the main options.
Currently, biofuels are the only renewable fuels available at scale and are
stimulated by blending mandates. Here, we estimate the system cost of enforcing
such mandates in addition to an overall emissions cap for all energy sectors.
We model overnight scenarios for 2040 and 2060 with the sector-coupled European
energy system model PyPSA-Eur-Sec, with a high temporal resolution. The
following cost drivers are identified: (i) high biomass costs due to scarcity,
(ii) opportunity costs for competing usages of biomass for industry heat and
combined heat and power (CHP) with carbon capture, and (iii) lower scalability
and generally higher cost for biofuels compared to electrofuels and fossil
fuels combined with CDR. With a -80% emissions reduction target in 2040,
variable renewables, partial electrification of heat, industry and transport
and biomass use for CHP and industrial heat are important for achieving the
target at minimal cost. Abatement of remaining liquid fossil fuel use increases
system cost, with a 50% biofuel mandate increasing costs by 128-229 billion
EUR, or 39-82% of the liquid fuel cost. With a negative -105% emissions target
in 2060, fuel abatement options are necessary, and electrofuels or the use of
CDR to offset fossil fuel emissions are more competitive than biofuels. Biomass
is preferred in CHP and industry heat, combined with carbon capture to serve
negative emissions or electrofuel production, thereby utilising biogenic carbon
several times. Sensitivity analyses reveal significant uncertainties but
consistently support that higher biofuel mandates lead to higher costs.

Genotype networks in metabolic reaction spaces,"  Background: A metabolic genotype comprises all chemical reactions an organism
can catalyze via enzymes encoded in its genome. A genotype is viable in a given
environment if it is capable of producing all biomass components the organism
needs to survive and reproduce. Previous work has focused on the properties of
individual genotypes while little is known about how genome-scale metabolic
networks with a given function can vary in their reaction content. Results: We
here characterize spaces of such genotypes. Specifically, we study metabolic
genotypes whose phenotype is viability in minimal chemical environments that
differ in their sole carbon sources. We show that regardless of the number of
reactions in a metabolic genotype, the genotypes of a given phenotype typically
form vast, connected, and unstructured sets -- genotype networks -- that nearly
span the whole of genotype space. The robustness of metabolic phenotypes to
random reaction removal in such spaces has a narrow distribution with a high
mean. Different carbon sources differ in the number of metabolic genotypes in
their genotype network; this number decreases as a genotype is required to be
viable on increasing numbers of carbon sources, but much less than if metabolic
reactions were used independently across different chemical environments.
Conclusions: Our work shows that phenotype-preserving genotype networks have
generic organizational properties and that these properties are insensitive to
the number of reactions in metabolic genotypes.

astronomical chemical evolution path from graphene to PAH was studied based on
the first principles calculation. Step 1 is a nucleation of nano-carbon after
supernova by super-cooling at expanding helium sphere. As a typical model,
graphene molecule (C )24 having coronene skeleton with seven carbon hexagons
was tried.Step 2 is a proton sputtering and passivation on ejected graphene
molecule. Slow speed proton with energy less than 4.3eV makes hydrogenation,
Graphene molecule (C )24 was transformed to PAH (C24H12). Higher speed proton
having sufficient energy larger than 18.3 eV could make a void in a molecule as
like C23H12. Resulted structure was a combination of two carbon pentagons and
five hexagons. Step 3 is photo-ionization of those molecules by high energy
photon. Electrons are removed to make a molecule to cation. Model molecule
(C23H12) became mono-cation (C23H12)+, di-cation (C23H12)2+ and so on. Typical
energy difference between such cation was 6.5 and 10.8 eV. If the light source
has a nature of black-body radiation, effective temperature will be 18000K ~
24000K, which suggested that central light source star may have 4 to 7 times
heavier than our sun. Finally, theoretical IR spectrum was obtained. Especially
in case of (C23H12)2+, calculated emission spectrum revealed that among 13

ultraviolet (SPring-8 Compact SASE Source in Japan) and soft x-ray

by Raman spectroscopy, differential interference contrast, and atomic force
microscopy. A remarkable difference in the behavior of covalent (a-C) and
molecular (C60) carbonaceous solids is demonstrated under these irradiation
conditions. Low thresholds for ablation of a fullerene crystal (estimated to be
around 0.15 eV/atom for C60 vs 0.9 eV/atom for a-C in terms of the absorbed
dose) are caused by a low cohesive energy of fullerene crystals. An efficient
mechanism of the removal of intact C60 molecules from the irradiated crystal

"Devolatilization of Subducting Slabs, Part II: Volatile Fluxes and
  Storage","  Subduction is a crucial part of the long-term water and carbon cycling
between Earth's exosphere and interior. However, there is broad disagreement
over how much water and carbon is liberated from subducting slabs to the mantle
wedge and transported to island-arc volcanoes. In the companion paper Part I,
we parameterize the metamorphic reactions involving H$_2$O and CO$_2$ for
representative subducting lithologies. On this basis, a two-dimensional
reactive transport model is constructed in this Part II. We assess the various
controlling factors of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O release from subducting slabs. Model
results show that up-slab fluid flow directions produce a flux peak of CO$_2$
and H$_2$O at subarc depths. Moreover, infiltration of H$_2$O-rich fluids
sourced from hydrated slab mantle enhances decarbonation or carbonation at
lithological interfaces, increases slab surface fluxes, and redistributes
CO$_2$ from basalt and gabbro layers to the overlying sedimentary layer. As a
result, removal of the cap sediments (by diapirism or off-scraping) leads to
elevated slab surface CO$_2$ and H$_2$O fluxes. The modelled subduction
efficiency (the percentage of initially subducted volatiles retained until
$\sim$200 km deep) of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ is increased by open-system effects due
to fractionation within the interior of lithological layers.

"Measuring the coefficient of moisture expansion of Hysol 9396 loaded
  with boron nitride powder","  The future ATLAS ITk strip tracker will consist of 17,000 silicon strip
detector modules mounted on support structures called cores. Cores are
assembled from a number of components, among others carbon fibre facings,
honeycomb structure and carbon foam surrounding titanium tubes used for
cooling, using a two-component epoxy (Hysol 9396) loaded with boron nitride for
good thermal conductivity. The adhesive constitutes about 20 % of a core's
weight. During operation, the detector is cooled down to -40 $^\circ$C using
bi-phase carbon dioxide and flushed with dry gas to prevent condensation. The
effect of this temperature change has been simulated to study the impact of
Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) mismatches between different materials
and investigate resulting deformations and misalignment. In addition to the
shrinking of an adhesive during cooling, which can be estimated well using its
known CTE, flushing the detector volume with dry gas removes the moisture
contained in the adhesive, leading to an additional shrinking. In order to
estimate the impact of shrinking during drying, the Coefficient of Moisture
Expansion (CME) of Hysol samples with different contents of boron nitride as
well as their overall moisture absorption were measured and their extent
compared to the contraction associated with cooling.

Fractional counting of authorship to quantify scientific research output,"  We investigate the problem of counting co-authorhip in order to quantify the
impact and relevance of scientific research output through normalized
\textit{h-index} and \textit{g-index}. We use the papers whose authors belong
to a subset of full professors of the Italian Settore Scientifico Disciplinare

by the number of co-authors of each paper, are roughly present. The total
number of citations for each individuals, as well as their h-index and g-index,
strongly depends on the average number of co-authors. We show that, in order to
remove the dependence of the various indices on the two populations, the best
way to define a fractional counting of autorship is to divide the number of

co-authors. This allows us to obtain some information which can be used for a
better understanding of the scientific knowledge made through the process of

"Mechanism of Electrolyte-Induced Brightening in Single-Wall Carbon
  Nanotubes","  While addition of electrolyte to sodium dodecyl sulfate suspensions of
single-wall carbon nanotubes has been demonstrated to result in significant
brightening of the nanotube photoluminescence (PL), the brightening mechanism
has remained unresolved. Here, we probe this mechanism using time-resolved PL
decay measurements. We find that PL decay times increase by a factor of 2 on
addition of CsCl as the electrolyte. Such an increase directly parallels an
observed near-doubling of PL intensity, indicating the brightening results
primarily from changes in nonradiative decay rates associated with exciton
diffusion to quenching sites. Our findings indicate that a reduced number of
these sites results from electrolyte-induced reorientation of the surfactant
surface structure that partially removes pockets of water from the tube surface
where excitons can dissociate, and thus underscores the contribution of
interfacial water in exciton recombination processes.

Photometry of LROC NAC resolved rock-rich regions on the Moon,"  The study of meter and sub-meter scale geological features, especially
boulders and boulder fields, on the surface of airless bodies can provide
insight into the evolution of the regolith and the contribution of various
processes to its formation. Prior studies have examined the photometric
properties of the lunar regolith surrounding young craters using image ratios.
We extend this methodology to extracting surface properties, in particular the
roughness characteristics, exclusive to boulder fields and the boulders that
constitute them around impact craters. In this study, rock-rich regions on the
Moon are investigated using photometric roughness by employing a normalised
logarithmic phase ratio difference metric to measure and compare the slope of
the phase curve (reflectance versus phase angle) of a rock-rich field to a
rock-free field. We compare the photometric roughness of rock-rich fields on
simulated images with the photometric roughness of rock-rich fields on LROC NAC
images (0.5m/pixel). Using this technique, we determine that rock-rich surfaces
are not necessarily photometrically rougher than rock-free areas. Additionally,
we find the roughness of resolved rock fields to indicate the presence of
diverse sub-mm scale rock roughness (microtopography) and, possibly, variable
rock single scattering albedo. These latter properties are likely controlled by
rock petrology and material response to weathering and erosion. Spatial
clustering of photometrically smooth and rough boulder fields in the downrange
and uprange of two craters is observed, reflecting ejecta asymmetry and
possibly indicating asymmetric modification of ejecta rock surfaces during the
impact excavation process.

Lithologic Controls on Silicate Weathering Regimes of Temperate Planets,"  Weathering of silicate rocks at a planetary surface can draw down CO$_2$ from
the atmosphere for eventual burial and long-term storage in the planetary
interior. This process is thought to provide an essential negative feedback to
the carbonate-silicate cycle (carbon cycle) to maintain clement climates on
Earth and potentially similar temperate exoplanets. We implement thermodynamics
to determine weathering rates as a function of surface lithology (rock type).
These rates provide upper limits that allow estimating the maximum rate of
weathering in regulating climate. This modeling shows that the weathering of
mineral assemblages in a given rock, rather than individual minerals, is
crucial to determine weathering rates at planetary surfaces. By implementing a
fluid-transport controlled approach, we further mimic chemical kinetics and
thermodynamics to determine weathering rates for three types of rocks inspired
by the lithologies of Earth's continental and oceanic crust, and its upper
mantle. We find that thermodynamic weathering rates of a continental crust-like
lithology are about one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of a
lithology characteristic of the oceanic crust. We show that when the CO$_2$
partial pressure decreases or surface temperature increases, thermodynamics
rather than kinetics exerts a strong control on weathering. The kinetically-
and thermodynamically-limited regimes of weathering depend on lithology,
whereas, the supply-limited weathering is independent of lithology. Our results
imply that the temperature-sensitivity of thermodynamically-limited silicate
weathering may instigate a positive feedback to the carbon cycle, in which the
weathering rate decreases as the surface temperature increases.

"Initial validation of a soil-based mass-balance approach for empirical
  monitoring of enhanced rock weathering rates","  Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) is a promising scalable and cost-effective
Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategy with significant environmental and
agronomic co-benefits. A major barrier to large-scale implementation of ERW is
a robust Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework. To
successfully quantify the amount of carbon dioxide removed by ERW, MRV must be
accurate, precise, and cost-effective. Here, we outline a mass-balance-based
method where analysis of the chemical composition of soil samples is used to
track in-situ silicate rock weathering. We show that signal-to-noise issues of
in-situ soil analysis can be mitigated by using isotope-dilution mass
spectrometry to reduce analytical error. We implement a proof-of-concept
experiment demonstrating the method in controlled mesocosms. In our experiment,
basalt rock feedstock is added to soil columns containing the cereal crop
Sorghum bicolor at a rate equivalent to 50 t ha$^{-1}$. Using our approach, we
calculate rock weathering corresponding to an average initial CDR value of 1.44
+/- 0.27 tCO$_2$eq ha$^{-1}$ from our experiments after 235 days, within error
of an independent estimate calculated using conventional elemental budgeting of
reaction products. Our method provides a robust time-integrated estimate of
initial CDR, to feed into models that track and validate large-scale carbon
removal through ERW.

"The Role of Plate Tectonic-Climate Coupling and Exposed Land Area in the
  Development of Habitable Climates on Rocky Planets","  The long-term carbon cycle is vital for maintaining liquid water oceans on
rocky planets due to the negative climate feedbacks involved in silicate
weathering. Plate tectonics plays a crucial role in driving the long-term
carbon cycle because it is responsible for CO$_2$ degassing at ridges and arcs,
the return of CO$_2$ to the mantle through subduction, and supplying fresh,
weatherable rock to the surface via uplift and orogeny. However, the presence
of plate tectonics itself may depend on climate according to recent
geodynamical studies showing that cool surface temperatures are important for
maintaining vigorous plate tectonics. Using a simple carbon cycle model, I show
that the negative climate feedbacks inherent in the long-term carbon cycle are
uninhibited by climate's effect on plate tectonics. Furthermore, initial
atmospheric CO$_2$ conditions do not impact the final climate state reached
when the carbon cycle comes to equilibrium, as long as liquid water is present
and silicate weathering can occur. Thus an initially hot, CO$_2$ rich
atmosphere does not prevent the development of a temperate climate and plate
tectonics on a planet. However, globally supply-limited weathering does prevent
the development of temperate climates on planets with small subaerial land
areas and large total CO$_2$ budgets because supply-limited weathering lacks
stabilizing climate feedbacks. Planets in the supply-limited regime may become
inhospitable for life and could experience significant water loss.
Supply-limited weathering is less likely on plate tectonic planets, because
plate tectonics promotes high erosion rates and thus a greater supply of
bedrock to the surface.

"Mass-Balance MRV for Carbon Dioxide Removal by Enhanced Rock Weathering:
  Methods, Simulation, and Inference","  Carbon dioxide will likely need to be removed from the atmosphere to avoid
significant future warming and climate change. Technologies are being developed
to remove large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere. Enhanced rock
weathering (ERW), where fine-grained silicate minerals are spread on soil, is a
promising carbon removal method that can also support crop yields and maintain
overall soil health. Quantifying the amount of carbon removed by ERW is crucial
for understanding the potential of ERW globally and for building trust in
commercial operations. However, reliable and scalable quantification in complex
media like soil is challenging and there is not yet a consensus on the best
method of doing so. Here we discuss mass-balance methods, where stocks of base
cations in soil are monitored over time to infer the amount of inorganic carbon
brought into solution by weathering reactions. First, we review the fundamental
concepts of mass-balance methods and explain different ways of approaching the
mass-balance problem. Then we discuss experimental planning and data
collection, suggesting some best practices. Next, we present a software package
designed to facilitate a range of tasks in ERW like uncertainty analysis,
planning field trials, and validating statistical methods. Finally, we briefly
review ways of estimating carbon removal using mass balance before discussing
some advantages of Bayesian inference in this context and presenting an example
Bayesian model. The model is fit to simulated data and recovers the correct

"Influence of relative sea-level rise, meteoritic water infiltration and
  rock weathering on giant volcanic landslides: theory and real cases","  Recent studies have shown that giant landslides seem to be correlated with
climatic variations. Nevertheless, the precise processes that are involved in
this phenomenon need to be better constrained. In this study, the causes of
giant landslides are investigated using a modeling approach. Here, we show that
the effect of meteoritic water infiltration could be discriminated from that of
sea-level rise on triggering paleolandslides. It is possible to identify the
cause of coastal paleolandslides based on the age of occurrence and comparison
with climatic signals when glacial maxima are more humid than during
interglacial times, as in Polynesia and East Equatorial Africa, but not in
other cases (Caribbean, Indonesia). The role of pore pressure variations and
sea-water loading variations has been discussed. The interaction between the
relative sea-level rise, preexisting relief and deep weak structure due to the
presence of highly weathered lavas may trigger the conditions for a large
landslide. Highly weathered lavas have very low friction angles at depth in
volcanic islands. When volcanoes are still actives, pressure variation of the
magma chamber caused by sea-level lowering is expected to play a significant
role in destabilization of the relief. Competing processes in real cases cause
difficulties to discriminate between these processes.

"Climates of Warm Earth-like Planets II: Rotational 'Goldilocks' Zones
  for Fractional Habitability and Silicate Weathering","  Planetary rotation rate has a significant effect on atmospheric circulation,
where the strength of the Coriolis effect in part determines the efficiency of
latitudinal heat transport, altering cloud distributions, surface temperatures,
and precipitation patterns. In this study we use the ROCKE-3D dynamic-ocean
general circulation model to study the effects of slow rotations and increased
insolations on the 'fractional habitability' and silicate weathering rate of an
Earth-like world. Defining the fractional habitability f_h to be the percentage
of a planet's surface which falls in the 0 <= T <= 100 C temperature regime, we
find a moderate increase in f_h with a 10% and 20% increase in insolation and a
possible maximum in f_h at sidereal day-lengths between 8 and 32 times that of
the modern Earth. By tracking precipitation and run-off we further determine
that there is a rotational regime centered on a 4-day period in which the
silicate weathering rate is maximized and is particularly strongly peaked at
higher overall insolations. Because of weathering's integral role in the
long-term carbonate-silicate cycle, we suggest that climate stability may be
strongly affected by the anticipated rotational evolution of temperate
terrestrial-type worlds, and should be considered a major factor in their
study. In light of our results we argue that planetary rotation period is an
important factor to consider when determining the habitability of terrestrial
worlds.

Origins of colors variability among C-cluster main-belt asteroids,"  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey provides colors for more than 100 000 moving
objects, among which around 10 000 have albedos determined. Here we combined
colors and albedo in order to perform a cluster analysis on the small bodies
population, and identify a C-cluster, a group of asteroid related to C-type as
defined in earlier work. Members of this C-cluster are in fair agreement with
the color boundaries of B and C-type defined in DeMeo and Carry (2013). We then
compare colors of C-cluster asteroids to those of carbonaceous chondrites
powders, while taking into account the effect of phase angle. We show that only
CM chondrites have colors in the range of C-cluster asteroids, CO, CR and CV
chondrites being significantly redder. Also, CM chondrites powders are on
average slightly redder than the average C-cluster. The colors of C-cluster
members are further investigated by looking at color variations as a function
of asteroid diameter. We observe that the visible slope becomes bluer with
decreasing asteroids diameter, and a transition seems to be present around 20
km. We discuss the origin of this variation and, if not related to a bias in
the dataset - analysis, we conclude that it is related to the surface texture
of the objects, smaller objects being covered by rocks, while larger objects
are covered by a particulate surface. The blueing is interpreted by an
increased contribution of the first reflection in the case of rock-dominated
surfaces, which can scatter light in a Rayleigh-like manner. We do not have
unambiguous evidence of space weathering within the C-cluster based on this
analysis, however the generally bluer nature of C-cluster objects compared to
CM chondrites could be to some extent related to space weathering.

"Phanerozoic biological reworking of the continental carbonate rock
  reservoir","  Understanding the co-evolution of complex life with Earth's geology is an
enduring challenge. The rock record evidences remarkable correlations between
changes in biology and the wider Earth system, yet cause and effect remain
unclear. Here, we link the evolutionary history of eukaryotes with the rise and
fall of carbonate rock fraction within continental crust - a key variable in
controlling the efficiency of carbon drawdown during weathering, solid Earth
degassing rates, and ultimately nutrient supply to life. We use geospatial
database analyses to demonstrate a strongly non-linear growth and then collapse
in Earth's continental crust carbonate reservoir. Biomineralisers reshaped
Earth's surface in their image; armouring continental margins with carbonate
platforms, such that the continental carbonate reservoir increased in size by
5-fold in under 100 Myr after the Cambrian Radiation of animal life. This
Paleozoic carbonate revolution represents among the most dramatic crustal
evolutionary events in Earth's history. The Permo-Triassic extinction event
coupled to the rise of open ocean calcifiers initiated a steady decline in
continental crustal carbonate content; one that still continues today, which
unabated would produce Precambrian-style crustal carbonate distributions in
around 500-1000 Myr. Our results demonstrate strongly non-linear crustal
evolution after the rise of the complex Phanerozoic biosphere. This outcome
suggests that complex life may generate unique biogeochemical trajectories on
otherwise geologically similar worlds, posing a new challenge in the hunt for
life beyond Earth.

Extraterrestrial sedimentary rocks on Earth,"  This concept article discusses the possibilities for identifying

heterogeneity of unmixed silicate reservoirs on Mars; (iv) possible terrestrial
loss or contamination in the noble gas signatures in new type meteorites that

Earth, Mars, Enceladus, Ganymede, Europa, and hypothetical planets that could
exist between orbits of Mars and Jupiter in the past. A parent body for
extraterrestrial sedimentary rocks on the Earth should be identified based on
the entire body of evidence which is not limited solely by tests of oxygen and
noble gas isotopes whose signatures may undergo terrestrial contamination and
may exhibit significant heterogeneity within the parent bodies. Observed fall
of cosmic body, evidence of hypervelocity impact complying with the criteria of

The Nonequilibrium Crystallization Force,"  The forces exerted by growing crystals on the surrounding materials play a
major role in many geological processes, from diagenetic replacement to rock
weathering and uplifting of rocks and soils. Although crystallization is a
nonequilibrium process, the available theoretical prediction for these forces
are based on equilibrium thermodynamics. Here we show that nonequilibrium
effects can lead to a drop of the crystallization force in large pores where
the crystal surface dissociates from the surrounding walls during growth. The
critical pore size above which such detachment can be observed depends only on
the ratio of kinetic coefficients and cannot be predicted from thermodynamics.
Our conclusions are based on a physical model which accounts for the
nonequilibrium kinetics of mass transport, and disjoining pressure effects
within the thin liquid film separating the crystal and the surrounding walls.
Our results suggest that the maximum size of the pores that can sustain
crystallization forces close to the equilibrium prediction ranges from
micrometers for salts to a millimetre for low solubility minerals such as
calcite. These results are discussed in the light of recent experimental
observations of the growth of confined salt crystals.

Quantized Neural Networks for Radar Interference Mitigation,"  Radar sensors are crucial for environment perception of driver assistance
systems as well as autonomous vehicles. Key performance factors are weather
resistance and the possibility to directly measure velocity. With a rising
number of radar sensors and the so far unregulated automotive radar frequency
band, mutual interference is inevitable and must be dealt with. Algorithms and
models operating on radar data in early processing stages are required to run
directly on specialized hardware, i.e. the radar sensor. This specialized
hardware typically has strict resource-constraints, i.e. a low memory capacity
and low computational power. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based
approaches for denoising and interference mitigation yield promising results
for radar processing in terms of performance. However, these models typically
contain millions of parameters, stored in hundreds of megabytes of memory, and
require additional memory during execution. In this paper we investigate
quantization techniques for CNN-based denoising and interference mitigation of
radar signals. We analyze the quantization potential of different CNN-based
model architectures and sizes by considering (i) quantized weights and (ii)

Climate Stability of Habitable Earth-like Planets,"  The carbon-silicate cycle regulates the atmospheric $CO_2$ content of
terrestrial planets on geological timescales through a balance between the
rates of $CO_2$ volcanic outgassing and planetary intake from rock weathering.
It is thought to act as an efficient climatic thermostat on Earth and, by
extension, on other habitable planets. If, however, the weathering rate
increases with the atmospheric $CO_2$ content, as expected on planets lacking
land vascular plants, the carbon-silicate cycle feedback can become severely
limited. Here we show that Earth-like planets receiving less sunlight than
current Earth may no longer possess a stable warm climate but instead
repeatedly cycle between unstable glaciated and deglaciated climatic states.
This has implications for the search for life on exoplanets in the habitable
zone of nearby stars.

"Searching for color variation on fast rotating asteroids with
  simultaneous V-J observations","  Boulders, rocks and regolith on fast rotating asteroids (<2.5 hours) are
modeled to slide towards the equator due to a strong centrifugal force and a
low cohesion force. As a result, regions of fresh subsurface material can be
exposed. Therefore, we searched for color variation on small and fast rotating
asteroids. We describe a novel technique in which the asteroid is
simultaneously observed in the visible and near-IR wavelength range. In this
technique, brightness changes due to atmospheric extinction effects can be
calibrated across the visible and near-IR images. We use V- and J-band filters
since the distinction in color between weathered and unweathered surfaces on
ordinary chondrite-like bodies is most prominent at these wavelengths and can
reach ~25%. To test our method, we observed 3 asteroids with Cerro Tololo's 1.3
m telescope. We find ~5% variation of the mean V-J color, but do not find any
clearly repeating color signature through multiple rotations. This suggests
that no landslides occurred within the timescale of space weathering, or that
Landslides occurred but the exposed patches are too small for the measurements'
uncertainty.

"Stress state evolution of a cemented granular material subjected to bond
  dissolution by Discrete Element Modeling","  Rock weathering is a common phenomenon in most engineering applications, such
as underground storage or geothermal energy. This work offers a discrete
element modelization of the problem considering cohesive granular material and
debonding effect. Oedometer conditions are applied during the weathering and
the evolution of the coefficient of lateral earth pressure, a proxy of the
state of stress, is tracked. Especially, the influence of the degree of
cementation, the confining pressure, the initial value of k0 and the history of
load are investigated. It has been emphasized that the granular media aims to
reach an attractor configuration. And the grain reorganization occurring is
divided into two main phenomena: the collapse of the unstable chain forces
(stable only thanks to the cementation) and the softening of the grains.

"Ecosystem-bedrock interaction changes nutrient compartmentalization
  during early oxidative weathering","  Ecosystem-bedrock interactions power the biogeochemical cycles of Earth's
shallow crust, supporting life, stimulating substrate transformation, and
spurring evolutionary innovation. While oxidative processes have dominated half
of terrestrial history, the relative contribution of the biosphere and its
chemical fingerprints on Earth's developing regolith are still poorly
constrained. Here, we report results from a two-year incipient weathering
experiment. We found that the mass release and compartmentalization of major
elements during weathering of granite, rhyolite, schist and basalt was
rock-specific and regulated by ecosystem components.
  A tight interplay between physiological needs of different biota, mineral
dissolution rates, and substrate nutrient availability resulted in intricate
elemental distribution patterns. Biota accelerated CO2 mineralization over
abiotic controls as ecosystem complexity increased, and significantly modified
stoichiometry of mobilized elements. Microbial and fungal components inhibited
element leaching (23.4% and 7%), while plants increased leaching and biomass
retention by 63.4%. All biota left comparable biosignatures in the dissolved
weathering products. Nevertheless, the magnitude and allocation of weathered
fractions under abiotic and biotic treatments provide quantitative evidence for
the role of major biosphere components in the evolution of upper continental
crust, presenting critical information for large-scale biogeochemical models
and for the search for stable in situ biosignatures beyond Earth.

"$δ^{44/40}$Ca-$δ^{88/86}$Sr multi-proxy constrains primary
  origin of Marinoan cap carbonates","  The Neoproterozoic Earth experienced at least two global-scale glaciations
termed Snowball Earth events. 'Cap carbonates' were widely deposited after the
events, but controversy surrounds their origin. Here, we apply the novel
$\delta^{44/40}$Ca-$\delta^{88/86}$Sr multi-proxy to two Marinoan (ca. 635 Ma)
cap carbonate sequences from Namibia and show that the rocks archive primary
environmental signals deriving from a combination of seawater-glacial meltwater
mixing and kinetic isotope effects. In an outer platform section, dolostone
$\delta^{44/40}$Ca and $\delta^{88/86}$Sr values define a line predicted for
kinetic mass-dependent isotope fractionation. This dolostone mostly
precipitated from meltwater. Moreover, stratigraphically higher samples
exhibiting the fastest precipitation rates correlate with elevated 87Sr/86Sr
ratios, consistent with long-held expectations that a rapid deglacial
weathering pulse forced cap carbonate formation. An inner-platform dolostone
shows greater effects from water-mass mixing but still reveals that
precipitation rates increased up-section. Overlying limestones show the
greatest Ca and Sr contributions from seawater. Amplification of local coastal
processes during global ice sheet collapse offers a simple but sufficient
proposition to explain the Ca isotope heterogeneity of cap carbonates.
Detection of kinetic isotope effects in the rock record provides a basis for
developing the $\delta^{44/40}$Ca-$\delta^{88/86}$Sr multi-proxy as an
indicator of saturation state and $p$CO$_2$.

"Mineralogy, reflectance spectra, and physical properties of the
  Chelyabinsk LL5 chondrite, insight into shock induced changes in asteroid
  regoliths","  The mineralogy and physical properties of Chelyabinsk meteorites (fall,
February 15, 2013) are presented. Three types of meteorite material are
present, described as the light-colored, dark-colored, and impact-melt
lithologies. All are of LL5 composition with the impact-melt lithology being
close to whole-rock melt and the dark-colored lithology being shock-darkened
due to partial melting of iron metal and sulfides. This enables us to study the
effect of increasing shock on material with identical composition and origin.
Based on the magnetic susceptibility, the Chelyabinsk meteorites are richer in
metallic iron as compared to other LL chondrites. The measured bulk and grain
densities and the porosity closely resemble other LL chondrites. Shock
darkening does not have a significant effect on the material physical
properties, but causes a decrease of reflectance and decrease in silicate
absorption bands in the reflectance spectra. This is similar to the space
weathering effects observed on asteroids. However, compared to space weathered
materials, there is a negligible to minor slope change observed in impact-melt
and shock-darkened meteorite spectra. Thus, it is possible that some dark
asteroids with invisible silicate absorption bands may be composed of
relatively fresh shock-darkened chondritic material.

"Petrophysical Characterization of Fractured Limestone from Beauce
  Aquifer Vadose Zone (O-ZNS Observatory, France)","  In recent years, water needs increased, driven by climate change and world
population growth. In this context, we study groundwater flow in the vadose
zone of Beauce aquifer (O-ZNS site, France). This lacustrine limestone vadose
zone is characterized by multi-scale heterogeneities. They are defined by
strongly various pore structures. This leads to uncertainties for reservoir
properties prediction using geophysical methods which impacts reservoir models
for flow simulations.In this study, we combined microstructure description and
petrophysical analysis in order to model and predict reservoir properties based
on different limestones facies and to infer the influence of
weathering/fracturing on both acoustics and electrical properties.A total of 16
samples from these facies were cored and characterized by their porosity,
permeability, acoustic velocities, complex electrical properties and
microstructure analysis.Based on our multi-method approach, we demonstrated the
influence of rock structure on reservoir properties prediction and modelling.
Petrophysical and microstructure characterization have highlighted two main
facies (microporous and homogenous facies and macroporous and heterogenous
facies) which can be used to improve reservoir and flow models. However,
further development is needed in order to quantify macropores and their link

The Complex Irradiation Facility at DLR-Bremen,"  All material exposed to interplanetary space conditions are subject to
degradation processes. For obvious reasons there is a great interest to study
these processes for materials that are used in satellite construction. However,
also the influence of particle and electromagnetic radiation on the weathering
of extraterrestrial rocks and on organic and biological tissues is the research
topic of various scientific disciplines. To strengthen the comprehensive and
systematic investigation of degradation processes a new laboratory, the complex
irradiation facility (CIF), has been designed, set up, tested, and put into
operation at the DLR-Institute of Space Systems in Bremen (Germany). The CIF

"Measurement of the Pressure induced by salt crystallization in
  confinement","  Salt crystallization is a major cause of weathering of artworks, monuments
and rocks. Damage will occur if crystals continue to grow in confinement, i.e.
within the pore space of these materials generating mechanical stresses. We
report on a novel method that allows to directly measure, at the microscale,
the resulting pressure while visualizing the spontaneous nucleation and growth
of alkali halide salts. The experiments reveal the crucial role of the wetting
films between the growing crystal and the confining walls for the development
of the pressure. The results suggest that the pressure originates from a charge
repulsion between the similarly charged wall and the crystal separated by a
~1.5 nm salt solution film. Consequently, if the walls are made hydrophobic, no
film and no crystallization pressure are detected. The magnitude of the
pressure is system-specific and explains how a growing crystal exerts stresses
at the scale of individual grains in porous materials.

"Transition between growth of dense and porous films: Theory of
  dual-layer SEI","  The formation of passivating films is a common aging phenomenon, for example
in weathering of rocks, silicon, and metals. In many cases, a dual-layer
structure with a dense inner and a porous outer layer emerges. However, the
origin of this dual-layer growth is so far not fully understood. In this work,
a continuum model is developed, which describes the morphology evolution of the
solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium-ion batteries. Transport through
the SEI and a growth reaction governed by the SEI surface energies are
modelled. In agreement with experiments, this theory predicts that SEI grows
initially as a dense film and subsequently as a porous layer. This dynamic
phase transition is driven by the slowing down of electron transport as the
film thickens. Thereby, the model offers a universal explanation for the
emergence of dual-layer structures in passivating films.

"Transforming U.S. agriculture with crushed rock for CO$_2$ sequestration
  and increased production","  Enhanced weathering (EW) is a promising modification to current agricultural
practices that uses crushed silicate rocks to drive carbon dioxide removal
(CDR). If widely adopted on farmlands, it could help achieve net-zero or
negative emissions by 2050. We report detailed state-level analysis indicating
EW deployed on agricultural land could sequester 0.23-0.38 Gt CO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$
and meet 36-60 % of U.S. technological CDR goals. Average CDR costs vary
between state, being highest in the first decades before declining to a range
of $\sim\$$100-150 tCO$_2{}^{-1}$ by 2050, including for three states (Iowa,
Illinois, and Indiana) that contribute most to total national CDR. We identify
multiple electoral swing states as being essential for scaling EW that are also
key beneficiaries of the practice, indicating the need for strong bipartisan
support of this technology. Assessment the geochemical capacity of rivers and
oceans to carry dissolved EW products from soil drainage suggests EW provides
secure long-term CO$_2$ removal on intergenerational time scales. We
additionally forecast mitigation of ground-level ozone increases expected with
future climate change, as an indirect benefit of EW, and consequent avoidance
of yield reductions. Our assessment supports EW as a practical innovation for
leveraging agriculture to enable positive action on climate change with
adherence to federal environmental justice priorities. However, implementing a
stage-gating framework as upscaling proceeds to safeguard against environmental
and biodiversity concerns will be essential.

Modeling Weather Uncertainty for Multi-weather Co-Presence Estimation,"  Images from outdoor scenes may be taken under various weather conditions. It
is well studied that weather impacts the performance of computer vision
algorithms and needs to be handled properly. However, existing algorithms model
weather condition as a discrete status and estimate it using multi-label
classification. The fact is that, physically, specifically in meteorology,
weather are modeled as a continuous and transitional status. Instead of
directly implementing hard classification as existing multi-weather
classification methods do, we consider the physical formulation of
multi-weather conditions and model the impact of physical-related parameter on
learning from the image appearance. In this paper, we start with solid revisit
of the physics definition of weather and how it can be described as a
continuous machine learning and computer vision task. Namely, we propose to
model the weather uncertainty, where the level of probability and co-existence
of multiple weather conditions are both considered. A Gaussian mixture model is
used to encapsulate the weather uncertainty and a uncertainty-aware
multi-weather learning scheme is proposed based on prior-posterior learning. A
novel multi-weather co-presence estimation transformer (MeFormer) is proposed.
In addition, a new multi-weather co-presence estimation (MePe) dataset, along
with 14 fine-grained weather categories and 16,078 samples, is proposed to
benchmark both conventional multi-label weather classification task and
multi-weather co-presence estimation task. Large scale experiments show that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and substantial
generalization capabilities on both the conventional multi-label weather
classification task and the proposed multi-weather co-presence estimation task.
Besides, modeling weather uncertainty also benefits adverse-weather semantic
segmentation.

Time Scales for Rounding of Rocks through Stochastic Chipping,"  For 3D geometries, we consider stones (modeled as convex polyhedra) subject
to weathering with planar slices of random orientation and depth successively
removing material, ultimately yielding smooth and round (i.e. spherical)
shapes. An exponentially decaying acceptance probability in the area exposed by
a prospective slice provides a stochastically driven physical basis for the
removal of material in fracture events. With a variety of quantitative
measures, in steady state we find a power law decay of deviations in a
toughness parameter $\gamma$ from a perfect spherical shape. We examine the
time evolution of shapes for stones initially in the form of cubes as well as
irregular fragments created by cleaving a regular solid many times along random
fracture planes. In the case of the former, we find two sets of second order
structural phase transitions with the usual hallmarks of critical behavior. The
first involves the simultaneous loss of facets original to the parent solid,
while the second of these involves a shift to a spherical profile.
Nevertheless, for mono-dispersed irregular solids, the loss of primordial
facets is not simultaneous but occurs in stages. In the case of initially
irregular stones, strong disorder obscures individual structural transitions,
and relevant observables are smooth with respect to time. More broadly, we find
that salient times scale quadratically in $\gamma$. We use the universal
dependence of variables on the volume remaining to calculate time dependent
variables for a variety of erosion scenarios with results from a single
weathering scheme such as the case in which the fracture acceptance probability
depends on the relative area of the prospective new face. We calculate time
scales for the attainment of structural milestones, obtaining a closed form
approximate expression which bounds direct simulation results from above.

"Digital Rock Typing DRT Algorithm Formulation with Optimal Supervised

all physical and chemical properties of that block. The properties that

Water-Trapped Worlds,"  Although tidally-locked habitable planets orbiting nearby M-dwarf stars are
among the best astronomical targets to search for extrasolar life, they may
also be deficient in volatiles and water. Climate models for this class of
planets show atmospheric transport of water from the dayside to the nightside,
where it is precipitated as snow and trapped as ice. Since ice only slowly
flows back to the dayside upon accumulation, the resulting hydrological cycle
can trap a large amount of water in the form of nightside ice. Using ice sheet
dynamical and thermodynamical constraints, I illustrate how planets with less
than about a quarter the Earth's oceans could trap most of their surface water
on the nightside. This would leave their dayside, where habitable conditions
are met, potentially dry. The amount and distribution of residual liquid water
on the dayside depend on a variety of geophysical factors, including the
efficiency of rock weathering at regulating atmospheric CO2 as dayside ocean
basins dry-up. Water-trapped worlds with dry daysides may offer similar
advantages as land planets for habitability, by contrast with worlds where more
abundant water freely flows around the globe.

"Methane bursts as a trigger for intermittent lake-forming climates on
  post-Noachian Mars","  Lakes existed on Mars later than 3.6 billion years ago, according to
sedimentary evidence for deltaic deposition. The observed fluvio-lacustrine
deposits suggest that individual lake-forming climates persisted for at least
several thousand years (assuming dilute flow). But the lake watersheds' little
weathered soils indicate a largely dry climate history, with intermittent
runoff events. Here we show that these observational constraints, while
inconsistent with many previously-proposed triggers for lake-forming climates,
are consistent with a methane burst scenario. In this scenario, chaotic
transitions in mean obliquity drive latitudinal shifts in temperature and ice
loading that destabilize methane clathrate. Using numerical simulations, we
find that outgassed methane can build up to atmospheric levels sufficient for
lake forming climates, for past clathrate hydrate stability zone occupancy
fractions >0.04. Such occupancy fractions are consistent with methane
production by water-rock reactions due to hydrothermal circulation on early
Mars. We further estimate that photochemical destruction of atmospheric methane
curtails the duration of individual lake-forming climates to less than a
million years, consistent with observations. We conclude that methane bursts
represent a potential pathway for intermittent excursions to a warm, wet
climate state on early Mars.

Carbon cycling and habitability of Earth-size stagnant lid planets,"  Models of thermal evolution, crustal production, and CO$_2$ cycling are used
to constrain the prospects for habitability of rocky planets, with Earth-like
size and composition, in the stagnant lid regime. Specifically, we determine
the conditions under which such planets can maintain rates of CO$_2$ degassing
large enough to prevent global surface glaciation, but small enough so as not
to exceed the upper limit on weathering rates provided by the supply of fresh
rock, a situation which would lead to runaway atmospheric CO$_2$ accumulation
and an inhospitably hot climate. The models show that stagnant lid planets with
initial radiogenic heating rates of 100-250 TW, and with total CO$_2$ budgets
ranging from $\sim 10^{-2} -1$ times Earth's estimated CO$_2$ budget, can
maintain volcanic outgassing rates suitable for habitability for $\approx 1-5$
Gyrs; larger CO$_2$ budgets result in uninhabitably hot climates, while smaller
budgets result in global glaciation. High radiogenic heat production rates
favor habitability by sustaining volcanism and CO$_2$ outgassing longer. Thus,
the results suggest that plate tectonics may not be required for establishing a
long-term carbon cycle and maintaining a stable, habitable climate. The model
is necessarily highly simplified, as the uncertainties with exoplanet thermal
evolution and outgassing are large. Nevertheless, the results provide some
first order guidance for future exoplanet missions, by predicting the age at
which habitability becomes unlikely for a stagnant lid planet as a function of
initial radiogenic heat budget. This prediction is powerful because both planet
heat budget and age can potentially be constrained from stellar observations.

"Reactive transport under stress: Permeability evolution in deformable
  porous media","  We study reactive transport in a stressed porous media, where dissolution of
the solid matrix causes two simultaneous, competing effects: pore enlargement
(chemical deformation), and pore compaction due to mechanical weakening. A
novel, mechanistic pore-scale model simulates flooding of a sample under fixed
confining stress, showing that increasing stress inhibits permeability
enhancement, increasing the injected volume required to reach a certain
permeability, in agreement with recent experiments. We explain this behavior by
stress concentration downstream, in the less dissolved (hence stiffer) region.
As this region is also less conductive, even its small compaction has a strong
bottleneck effect that curbs the permeability.
  Our results also elucidate that the impact of stress depends on the
dissolution regime. Under wormholing conditions (slow injection, i.e. high
Damkohler, $Da$), the development of a sharp dissolution front and high
porosity contrast accentuates the bottleneck effect. This reduces transport
heterogeneity, promoting wormhole competition. Once the outlet starts eroding,
the extreme focusing of transport and hence dissolution--characteristic of
wormholing--becomes dominant, diminishing the bottleneck effect and hence the
impact of stress. In contrast, at low $Da$, incomplete reaction upstream allows
the reagent to traverse the sample, causing a more uniform dissolution. The
continuous dissolution and its partial counteraction by compaction downstream
provides a steady, gradual increase in the effect of stress. Consequently, the
impact of stress is more pronounced at high $Da$ during early stages (low
permeability), and at low $Da$ close to breakthrough. Our work promotes
understanding of the hydromechanical property evolution, with important
implications for processes ranging from diagenesis and weathering of rocks, to
well stimulation and carbon geosequetration.

"The near surface vertical atmospheric electric field abnormality could
  be as a promising imminent precursor of major earthquakes","  A promising short term precursor of major earthquakes (EQ) is very crucial in
saving people and preventing huge losses. Ez, atmospheric electrostatic field
vertical component, under fair air conditions, is generally oriented downwards
(positive). Anomalous negative Ez signals could be used as an indicator of a
great number of radioactive gases which are released from great number of rock
clefts just before major earthquakes. Enhanced emission of radon radioactive
decay will produce an anomalously large number of ion pairs. The positive
particles will be transported downward by the fair weather electrostatic field
and pile up near the surface. Finally, obviously and abnormally, an oriented
upward atmospheric electric field Ez near the ground could be formed.
Therefore, monitoring this Ez may be applied effectively in earthquake warning.

Disruption of Saturn's ring particles by thermal stress,"  Spacecraft and ground-based observations show that the main rings of Saturn
lack particles larger than 10 m. Tidal or collisional destruction of
satellites/comets have been proposed as the origin of the main rings; however,
Saturn's tide alone cannot grind km-sized fragments into submeter-sized
particles because of the high mechanical strength of water ice and rock. The
question arises as to why such large particles are not left in the current
ring. It is known that thermal stress induced by diurnal and seasonal
temperature variations can cause weathering and fragmentation of boulders and
contribute to dust and regolith production on the Moon and terrestrial planets,
and then such thermal stress can break particles larger than a critical radius
while cannot smaller than the critical radius. In this study, we examined the
role of thermal stress acting on Saturn's ring particles. We found that thermal
stress can grind porous ring particles larger than 10-20 m, which explains the
lack of particles larger than 10 m in Saturn's ring. Also, fragmentation by
thermal stress can be adoptable for the Epsilon rings of Uranus. Furthermore,
thermal stress caused by diurnal or seasonal temperature variation acting on
boulders on surfaces of icy satellites and asteroids may play an important role
in the evolution of their sizes. Our calculations explain the lack of boulders
on icy satellites, except in the geologically active provinces such as the
tiger stripes of Enceladus, where boulders are supplied by recent geological
activity. We predict that future observations can find numerous boulders around
Europa's geologically active cracks.

"Identifying meteorite droppers among the population of bright 'sporadic'
  bolides imaged by the Spanish Meteor Network during the spring of 2022","  The extraordinary weather conditions available between February and March
2022 over Spain have allowed us to analyze the brightest fireballs recorded by
the monitoring stations of the Spanish Meteor Network (SPMN). We study the
atmospheric flight of 15 large meteoroids to determine if they are meteorite
dropper events to prepare campaigns to search for freshly fallen
extraterrestrial material. We investigate their origins in the Solar System and
their dynamic association with parent bodies and meteoroid streams. Employing
our Python pipeline 3D-FireTOC, we reconstruct the atmospheric trajectory
utilizing ground-based multi-station observations and compute the heliocentric
orbit. In addition, we apply an ablation model to estimate the initial and
terminal mass of each event. Using a dissimilarity criterion and propagating
backward in time, we check the connection of these meteoroids with known
complexes and near-Earth objects. We also calculate if the orbits are
compatible with recent meteoroid ejections. We find that ~27% of these
fireballs are dynamically associated with minor meteoroid streams and exhibit
physical properties of cometary bodies, as well as one associated with a
near-Earth asteroid. We identify two meteorite-producing events; however, the
on-site search was unsuccessful. By considering that these fireballs are mostly
produced by cm-sized rocks that might be the fragmentation product of much
larger meteoroids, our findings emphasize the idea that the population of
near-Earth objects is a source of near-term impact hazards, existing large
Earth-colliding meteoroids in the known complexes.

"Multi-step Steady-State Measurements of Low Permeability Using Series
  Circuit with A Reference Rock Sample","  A multi-step steady-state (MSSS) method is proposed here for the measurement
of low permeability. This new method can accurately and easily measure very low
permeabilities of rock samples using a new setup, where the targeted rock
sample and ordinary apparatus components are connected with a reference rock
sample to form a series circuit. Any conventional rock sample with high
permeability could be used as a reference rock sample such that the traditional
steady-state measurement is feasible to accurately determine its permeability
as a reference value in the MSSS method. The challenging measurement of tiny
mass flux rate by advanced pump system is avoided and the permeability of
targeted rock sample can be directly computed using the pressure drops,
sectional areas and lengths of the two connected rock samples, and the known
permeability of the reference rock sample, based on the mass conservation
principle in a series circuit at steady state. Multi-step measurements using
additional reference rock samples will be needed if the pressure drop across
the first reference rock sample is too small to be accurately measured due to
high permeability ratio when it is connected with the targeted rock sample to
form a series circuit. The relative pressure drops can be small since the
measurement of flow speed is unnecessary, which improves the accuracy in
studying the dependence of gas permeability on the pore pressure. Consequently,
the advantages of the MSSS method include low expense, simplicity, high
accuracy and efficiency.

"Multifractal analysis of the pore space of real and simulated
  sedimentary rocks","  It is well known that sedimentary rocks having same porosity can have very
different pore size distribution. The pore distribution determines many
characteristics of the rock among which, its transport property is often the
most useful. Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool that is increasingly used
to characterize the pore space. In this study we have done multifractal
analysis of pore distribution on sedimentary rocks simulated using the Relaxed
Bidisperse Ballistic Model (RBBDM). The RBBDM can generate a $3-D$ structure of
sedimentary rocks of variable porosity by tuning the fraction $p$ of particles
of two different sizes. We have also done multifractal analysis on two samples
of real sedimentary rock to compare with the simulation studies. One sample, an
oolitic limestone is of high porosity (40%)while the other is a reefal
carbonate of low porosity around 7%. $2-D$ sections of X-ray micro-tomographs
of the real rocks were stacked sequentially to reconstruct the real rock
specimens. Both samples show a multifractal character, but we show that RBBDM
gives a very realistic representation of a typical high porosity sedimentary
rock.

"Quantifying and analyzing rock trait distributions of rocky fault scarps
  using deep learning approach","  We apply a deep learning model to segment and identify rock characteristics
based on a Structure-from-Motion orthomap and digital elevation model of a
rocky fault scarp in the Volcanic Tablelands, eastern California. By
post-processing the deep learning results, we build a semantic rock map and
analyze rock trait distributions. The resulting semantic map contains nearly
230,000 rocks with effective diameters ranging from 2 cm to 250 cm. Rock trait
distributions provide a new perspective on rocky fault scarp development and
extend past research on scarp geometry including slope, height, and length.
Heatmaps indicate rock size spatial distributions on the fault scarp and
surrounding topographic flats. Median grain size changes perpendicular to the
fault scarp trace with the largest rocks exposed on and downslope from the
scarp footwall. Correlation analyses of the segmented fault scarp illustrate
the relationship between rock trait statistics and fault scarp geomorphology.
Local fault scarp height correlates with median grain size (R2 of 0.6), the
mean grain size of the largest rocks (R2 of 0.76), and the ratio of the number
of small to large rocks (R2 of 0.40). The positive correlation (R2 of 0.81)
between local fault scarp height and standard deviation of grain size suggests
that rocks on a higher fault scarp are less well sorted. The correlation
analysis between fault scarp height and rock orientation statistics supports a
particle transportation model in which locally higher fault scarps have
relatively more rocks with long axes parallel to fault scarp trace because
rocks have a larger distance to roll and orient the long axes. Our work
demonstrates a data-driven approach to geomorphology based on rock trait
distributions, promising a greater understanding of fault scarp formation, as
well as many other applications for which granulometry is an indicator of
process.

"Weather GAN: Multi-Domain Weather Translation Using Generative
  Adversarial Networks","  In this paper, a new task is proposed, namely, weather translation, which
refers to transferring weather conditions of the image from one category to
another. It is important for photographic style transfer. Although lots of
approaches have been proposed in traditional image translation tasks, few of
them can handle the multi-category weather translation task, since weather
conditions have rich categories and highly complex semantic structures. To
address this problem, we develop a multi-domain weather translation approach
based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), denoted as Weather GAN, which
can achieve the transferring of weather conditions among sunny, cloudy, foggy,
rainy and snowy. Specifically, the weather conditions in the image are
determined by various weather-cues, such as cloud, blue sky, wet ground, etc.
Therefore, it is essential for weather translation to focus the main attention
on weather-cues. To this end, the generator of Weather GAN is composed of an
initial translation module, an attention module and a weather-cue segmentation
module. The initial translation module performs global translation during
generation procedure. The weather-cue segmentation module identifies the
structure and exact distribution of weather-cues. The attention module learns
to focus on the interesting areas of the image while keeping other areas
unaltered. The final generated result is synthesized by these three parts. This
approach suppresses the distortion and deformation caused by weather
translation. our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts has been shown by a
large number of experiments and evaluations.

"Video Adverse-Weather-Component Suppression Network via Weather
  Messenger and Adversarial Backpropagation","  Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed to remove
adverse weather conditions in single images using a single set of pre-trained
weights, they fail to restore weather videos due to the absence of temporal
information. Furthermore, existing methods for removing adverse weather
conditions (e.g., rain, fog, and snow) from videos can only handle one type of
adverse weather. In this work, we propose the first framework for restoring
videos from all adverse weather conditions by developing a video
adverse-weather-component suppression network (ViWS-Net). To achieve this, we
first devise a weather-agnostic video transformer encoder with multiple
transformer stages. Moreover, we design a long short-term temporal modeling
mechanism for weather messenger to early fuse input adjacent video frames and
learn weather-specific information. We further introduce a weather
discriminator with gradient reversion, to maintain the weather-invariant common
information and suppress the weather-specific information in pixel features, by
adversarially predicting weather types. Finally, we develop a messenger-driven
video transformer decoder to retrieve the residual weather-specific feature,
which is spatiotemporally aggregated with hierarchical pixel features and
refined to predict the clean target frame of input videos. Experimental
results, on benchmark datasets and real-world weather videos, demonstrate that
our ViWS-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of restoring
videos degraded by any weather condition.

OpenWeather: a peer-to-peer weather data transmission protocol,"  The study of the weather is performed using instruments termed weather
stations. These weather stations are distributed around the world, collecting
the data from the different phenomena. Several weather organizations have been
deploying thousands of these instruments, creating big networks to collect
weather data. These instruments are collecting the weather data and delivering
it for later processing in the collections points. Nevertheless, all the
methodologies used to transmit the weather data are based in protocols non
adapted for this purpose. Thus, the weather stations are limited by the data
formats and protocols used in them, not taking advantage of the real-time data
available on them. We research the weather instruments, their technology and
their network capabilities, in order to provide a solution for the mentioned
problem. OpenWeather is the protocol proposed to provide a more optimum and
reliable way to transmit the weather data. We evaluate the environmental
factors, such as location or bandwidth availability, in order to design a
protocol adapted to the requirements established by the automatic weather
stations. A peer to peer architecture is proposed, providing a functional
implementation of OpenWeather protocol. The evaluation of the protocol is
executed in a real scenario, providing the hints to adapt the protocol to a
common automatic weather station.

"Point-Cloud-Based Aerial Fragmentation Analysis for Application in the
  Minerals Industry","  This work investigates the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
technology for measurement of rock fragmentation without placement of scale
objects in the scene to determine image scale. Commonly practiced image-based
rock fragmentation analysis requires a technician to walk to a rock pile, place
a scale object of known size in the area of interest, and capture individual 2D
images. Our previous work has used UAV technology for the first time to acquire
real-time rock fragmentation data and has shown comparable quality of results;
however, it still required the (potentially dangerous) placement of scale
objects, and continued to make the assumption that the rock pile surface is
planar and that the scale objects lie on the surface plane. This work improves
our UAV-based approach to enable rock fragmentation measurement without
placement of scale objects and without the assumption of planarity. This is
achieved by first generating a point cloud of the rock pile from 2D images,
taking into account intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, and then taking
2D images for fragmentation analysis. This work represents an important step
towards automating post-blast rock fragmentation analysis. In experiments, a
rock pile with known size distribution was photographed by the UAV with and
without using scale objects. For fragmentation analysis without scale objects,
a point cloud of the rock pile was generated and used to compute image scale.
Comparison of the rock size distributions show that this point-cloud-based
method enables producing measurements with better or comparable accuracy
(within 10% of the ground truth) to the manual method with scale objects.

"Digital rock reconstruction with user-defined properties using
  conditional generative adversarial networks","  Uncertainty is ubiquitous with flow in subsurface rocks because of their
inherent heterogeneity and lack of in-situ measurements. To complete
uncertainty analysis in a multi-scale manner, it is a prerequisite to provide
sufficient rock samples. Even though the advent of digital rock technology
offers opportunities to reproduce rocks, it still cannot be utilized to provide
massive samples due to its high cost, thus leading to the development of
diversified mathematical methods. Among them, two-point statistics (TPS) and
multi-point statistics (MPS) are commonly utilized, which feature incorporating
low-order and high-order statistical information, respectively. Recently,
generative adversarial networks (GANs) are becoming increasingly popular since
they can reproduce training images with excellent visual and consequent
geologic realism. However, standard GANs can only incorporate information from
data, while leaving no interface for user-defined properties, and thus may
limit the representativeness of reconstructed samples. In this study, we
propose conditional GANs for digital rock reconstruction, aiming to reproduce
samples not only similar to the real training data, but also satisfying
user-specified properties. In fact, the proposed framework can realize the
targets of MPS and TPS simultaneously by incorporating high-order information
directly from rock images with the GANs scheme, while preserving low-order
counterparts through conditioning. We conduct three reconstruction experiments,
and the results demonstrate that rock type, rock porosity, and correlation
length can be successfully conditioned to affect the reconstructed rock images.
Furthermore, in contrast to existing GANs, the proposed conditioning enables
learning of multiple rock types simultaneously, and thus invisibly saves
computational cost.

Numerical investigation of the scale effects of rock bridges,"  The concept of joint persistence has been widely used to study the mechanics
and failure processes of rock masses benefitting from the simplicity of
statistical linear weighing of the discontinuity. Nevertheless, this term
neglects the scale effects of rock bridges, meaning that the same joint
persistence may refer to different numbers and spacings of rock bridges,
leading to erroneous equivalent rock mass responses. To fill in this gap, an
intact rock bridge was dispersed as multi rock bridges while maintaining a
constant joint persistence, subjected to direct shear by conducting numerical
simulations employing Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC). In this way,
scale effects of rock bridges were investigated from the perspective of
load-displacement curves, stress and displacement fields, crack propagations
and AE characterizations. Results revealed that the shear resistance and the
area and value of stress-concentration decreased with increasing dispersion.
Furthermore, uneven distribution of displacement fields in an arc manner moving
and degrading away from the load was first observed, indicating the sequential
failure of multi rock bridges. It was also found that the propagation of wing
cracks was insensitive to scale, while the asperity of macro shear fracture
mainly formed by secondary cracks decreased with increasing dispersion. In
addition, increasing dispersion of rock bridges would overlap the failure
precursors identified by intense AE activities. Based on the abovementioned
results, we evaluated existing methods to characterize the joint persistence,
and a threshold was observed to possibly define a rock bridge.

"Zero-Shot Digital Rock Image Segmentation with a Fine-Tuned Segment
  Anything Model","  Accurate image segmentation is crucial in reservoir modelling and material
characterization, enhancing oil and gas extraction efficiency through detailed
reservoir models. This precision offers insights into rock properties,
advancing digital rock physics understanding. However, creating pixel-level
annotations for complex CT and SEM rock images is challenging due to their size
and low contrast, lengthening analysis time. This has spurred interest in
advanced semi-supervised and unsupervised segmentation techniques in digital
rock image analysis, promising more efficient, accurate, and less
labour-intensive methods. Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) revolutionized
image segmentation in 2023, offering interactive and automated segmentation
with zero-shot capabilities, essential for digital rock physics with limited
training data and complex image features. Despite its advanced features, SAM
struggles with rock CT/SEM images due to their absence in its training set and
the low-contrast nature of grayscale images. Our research fine-tunes SAM for
rock CT/SEM image segmentation, optimizing parameters and handling large-scale
images to improve accuracy. Experiments on rock CT and SEM images show that
fine-tuning significantly enhances SAM's performance, enabling high-quality
mask generation in digital rock image analysis. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the fine-tuned SAM model (RockSAM) for rock

Tautochrone and Brachistochrone Shape Solutions for Rocking Rigid Bodies,"  Rocking rigid bodies appear in several shapes in everyday life: As furniture
like rocking chairs and rocking cradles or as toys like rocking horses or

combination of a rigid rotation and a translation of the center of mass, gives
rise to a number of interesting dynamical properties. However, their study has
received little attention in the literature.
  This work presents a comprehensive introduction to the dynamics of rocking
rigid bodies, including a concise derivation of the equations of motion as well
as a general inversion procedure to construct rocking rigid body shapes with
specified dynamical properties. Moreover, two novel rigid body shapes are
derived - the tautochrone shape and the brachistochrone shape - which represent
an intriguing generalization of the well-know tautochrone and brachistochrone

Study on Dynamics of an Elastic Oscillator Coupled with a Rocking Wall,"  This paper studies the dynamics of an elastic single degree of freedom
oscillator (representing an elastic frame) coupled with a rocking wall. Two
types of rocking walls namely stepping rocking wall and pinned rocking wall are
presented and analyzed. For each case, full nonlinear equations of motions are
calculated. The dynamic behavior of the systems shows mixed results in
suppressing the dynamic response of the elastic oscillator. Through
comprehensive analysis, pinned rocking wall amplifies the displacement along
wide range of the spectrum, in the other hand, stepping rocking wall is the
most effective especially in relatively flexible structures and with a heavier
wall. This is mainly because of the pinned wall's mass works against its
stability. In this study, a simple, oscillator-rocking-wall model is defined
and analyzed using OpenSees and, the results from OpenSees shows a good
agreement with equation of motion solution using MATLAB.

"Assessing the efficiency of thermal pressurisation using natural
  pseudotachylyte-bearing rocks","  The efficiency of thermal pressurisation as a dynamic weakening mechanism
relies on the thermal and hydraulic properties of the rocks forming the fault
core. Here, we assess the effectiveness of thermal pressurisation by comparing
predictions of temperature rise to field estimates based on
pseudotachylyte-bearing rocks. We measure hydraulic and transport properties of
a suite of fault rocks (a healed cataclasite, an unhealed breccia and the
intact parent rock) from the pseudotachylyte-bearing Gole Larghe fault in the
Adamello batholith (Italy), and use them as inputs in numerical simulations of
thermal pressurisation. We find that the melting temperature can be reached
only if damaged, unhealed rock properties are used. A tenfold increase in
permeability, or a fourfold increase in pore compressibility of the intact rock
is required to achieve melting. Our results emphasise the importance of damage
processes that strongly modify fault rock properties and dynamic weakening
processes during earthquake propagation.

"The fillet of a rock on the Moon: Cohesion and size dependent abrasion

of airless surfaces. Debris aprons, of fillets, around rocks are an ubiquitous
morphology on many surfaces without atmosphere, which origin and evolution are
largely unknown. Here we show that fillet originates from the juxtaposed rock
under abrasion and that rocks of different cohesion have fillets with distinct
morphological evolution. Thus, a fillet around a rock allows to disentangle
rock cohesion from its surface exposure age. By combing topographic diffusion
modeling with images of blocks of known age on the Moon we find abrasion rates
for cm-sized boulders similar to regional rates (0.2 mm/Myr), whereas for 10-m
sized blocks the rate is two order of magnitude higher (20 mm/Myr). Rates for
instances of rocks of higher strength are reduced by ~50%. Fillets around lunar
rocks are consistent with abrasion by isotropic micrometeoroid bombardment.

"On the Coupling of Pressurized Flow and Elastic Expansion of Artificial
  Rocks","  Pressurized fluid injection into underground rocks occurs in applications
like carbon sequestration, hydraulic fracturing, and wastewater disposal, and
may lead to human-induced earthquakes and surface uplift. The fluid injection
raises the pore pressure within the porous rocks, while deforming them, yet
this coupling is not well understood as experimental studies of rocks are
usually limited to postmortem inspection and cannot capture the complete
deformation process in time and space. We investigate injection-induced
deformation of a unique rock-like transparent medium mimicking the deformation
of sandstone, yet under low pressure. By incorporating within this artificial
rock fluorescent microspheres we capture its internal deformation in real time
during the pressurized flow. We then modify the theory of poroelasticity to
model accurately and without any fitting parameters the internal elastic
deformations, hence providing a physical mechanism for the process. Moreover,
our results demonstrate and validate the underling assumptions of the
poroelastic theory for fluid injection in rock-like materials. Our results are
relevant for understanding human-induced earthquakes and injection induced
surface uplift, as they decouple the role of the pressurized flow from the rock
deformation through the poroelastic theory.

Rock Hunting With Martian Machine Vision,"  The Mars Perseverance rover applies computer vision for navigation and hazard
avoidance. The challenge to do onboard object recognition highlights the need
for low-power, customized training, often including low-contrast backgrounds.
We investigate deep learning methods for the classification and detection of
Martian rocks. We report greater than 97% accuracy for binary classifications
(rock vs. rover). We fine-tune a detector to render geo-located bounding boxes
while counting rocks. For these models to run on microcontrollers, we shrink

"The TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison (THAI). Part III:
  Simulated Observables -- The return of the spectrum","  The TRAPPIST-1 Habitable Atmosphere Intercomparison (THAI) is a community
project that aims to quantify how dfferences in general circulation models
(GCMs) could impact the climate prediction for TRAPPIST-1e and, subsequently
its atmospheric characterization in transit. Four GCMs have participated in
THAI so far: ExoCAM, LMD-Generic, ROCKE-3D and the UM. This paper, focused on
the simulated observations, is the third part of a trilogy, following the
analysis of two land planet scenarios (part I) and two aquaplanet scenarios
(part II). Here, we show a robust agreement between the simulated spectra and
the number of transits estimated to detect the land planet atmospheres. For the
aquaplanet ones, using atmospheric data from any of the four GCMs would require
at least 17 transits. This prediction corresponds to UM simulated data which
produces the lowest and thinnest clouds. Between 35-40% more clouds are
predicted by ExoCAM or LMD-G due to higher thick terminator clouds. For the
first time this work provides ""GCM uncertainty error bars"" of 35-40% that need
to be considered in future analyses of transmission spectra. We also analyzed
the inter-transit variability induced by weather patterns and changes of
terminator cloudiness between transits. Its magnitude differs significantly
between the GCMs but its impact on the transmission spectra is within the
measurement uncertainties. THAI has demonstrated the importance of model
intercomparison for exoplanets and also paved the way for a larger project to
develop an intercomparison meta-framework, namely the Climates Using

"Relative rates of fluid advection, elemental diffusion and replacement
  govern reaction front patterns","  Replacement reactions during fluid infiltration into porous media, rocks and
buildings are known to have important implications for reservoir development,
ore formation as well as weathering. Natural observations and experiments have
shown that in such systems the shape of reaction fronts can vary significantly
ranging from smooth, rough to highly irregular. It remains unclear what
process-related knowledge can be derived from these reaction front patterns. In
this contribution we show a numerical approach to test the effect of relative
rates of advection, diffusion and reaction on the development of reaction
fronts patterns in granular aggregates with permeable grain boundaries. The
numerical model takes (i) fluid infiltration along permeable grain boundaries,
(ii) reactions and (iii) elemental diffusion into account. We monitor the
change in element concentration within the fluid, while reactions occur at a
pre-defined rate as a function of the local fluid concentration. In
non-dimensional phase space using P{\'e}clet and Damk{\""o}hler numbers, results
show that there are no rough fronts without advection (P{\'e}clet<70) nor if
the reaction is too fast (Damk{\""o}hler>10-3). As advection becomes more
dominant and reaction slower, roughness develops across several grains with a
full microstructure mimicking replacement in the most extreme cases. The
reaction front patterns show an increase in roughness with increasing
P{\'e}clet number from P{\'e}clet 10 to 100 but then a decrease in roughness
towards higher P{\'e}clet numbers controlled by the Damk{\""o}hler number. Our
results indicate that reaction rates are crucial for pattern formation and that
the shape of reaction fronts is only partly due to the underlying transport
mechanism.

"Mid-Infrared spectroscopy of impactites from the Noerdlinger Ries impact
  crater","  This study is part of an effort to build a mid-infrared database (7-14micron)
of spectra for MERTIS (Mercury Radiometer and Thermal Infrared Spectrometer),
an instrument onboard of the ESA/JAXA BepiColombo space probe to be launched to
Mercury in 2017. Mercury was exposed to abundant impacts throughout its
history. This study of terrestrial impactites can provide estimates of the
effects of shock metamorphism on the mid-infrared spectral properties of
planetary materials. In this study, we focus on the Noerdlinger Ries crater in
Southern Germany, a well preserved and easily accessible impact crater with
abundant suevite impactites. Suevite and melt glass bulk samples from Otting
and Aumuehle, as well as red suevite from Polsingen were characterized and
their reflectance spectra in mid-infrared range obtained. In addition, in-situ
mid-infrared spectra were made from glasses and matrix areas in thin sections.
The results show similar, but distinguishable spectra for both bulk suevite and
melt glass samples, as well as in-situ measurements. Impact melt glass from
Aumuehle and Otting have spectra dominated by a Reststrahlen band at 9.3-9.6
micron. Bulk melt rock from Polsingen and bulk suevite and fine-grained matrix
have their strongest band between 9.4 to 9.6 micron. There are also features
between 8.5 and 9 micron, and 12.5 - 12.8 micron associated with crystalline
phases. There is evidence of weathering products in the fine-grained matrix,
such as smectites. Mercury endured many impacts with impactors of all sizes
over its history. So spectral characteristics observed for impactites formed
only in a single impact like in the Ries impact event can be expected to be
very common on planetary bodies exposed to many more impacts in their past. We
conclude that in mid-infrared remote sensing data the surface of Mercury can be
expected to be dominated by features of amorphous materials.

"Sit Back and Relax: Learning to Drive Incrementally in All Weather
  Conditions","  In autonomous driving scenarios, current object detection models show strong
performance when tested in clear weather. However, their performance
deteriorates significantly when tested in degrading weather conditions. In
addition, even when adapted to perform robustly in a sequence of different
weather conditions, they are often unable to perform well in all of them and
suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To efficiently mitigate forgetting, we
propose Domain-Incremental Learning through Activation Matching (DILAM), which
employs unsupervised feature alignment to adapt only the affine parameters of a
clear weather pre-trained network to different weather conditions. We propose
to store these affine parameters as a memory bank for each weather condition
and plug-in their weather-specific parameters during driving (i.e. test time)
when the respective weather conditions are encountered. Our memory bank is
extremely lightweight, since affine parameters account for less than 2% of a
typical object detector. Furthermore, contrary to previous domain-incremental
learning approaches, we do not require the weather label when testing and
propose to automatically infer the weather condition by a majority voting
linear classifier.

"DA-RAW: Domain Adaptive Object Detection for Real-World Adverse Weather
  Conditions","  Despite the success of deep learning-based object detection methods in recent
years, it is still challenging to make the object detector reliable in adverse
weather conditions such as rain and snow. For the robust performance of object
detectors, unsupervised domain adaptation has been utilized to adapt the
detection network trained on clear weather images to adverse weather images.
While previous methods do not explicitly address weather corruption during
adaptation, the domain gap between clear and adverse weather can be decomposed
into two factors with distinct characteristics: a style gap and a weather gap.
In this paper, we present an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for
object detection that can more effectively adapt to real-world environments
with adverse weather conditions by addressing these two gaps separately. Our
method resolves the style gap by concentrating on style-related information of
high-level features using an attention module. Using self-supervised
contrastive learning, our framework then reduces the weather gap and acquires
instance features that are robust to weather corruption. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods for object detection in
adverse weather conditions.

"On the effect of a two-rocks boundary on the propagation of nonlinear
  transients of temperature and pressure in deformable porous rocks","  We here analyze the propagation of transients of fluid-rock temperature and
pressure through a thin boundary layer, where a steady trend is present,
between two adjacent homogeneous rocks. We focus on the effect of convection on
transients crossing such thin layer. In comparison with early models where this
boundary was assumed a sharp mathematical plane separating the two rocks, here
we show a realistic analysis of such boundary layer that implies a novel
nonlinear model. Its solutions describe large amplitude, quick and sharp
transients characterized by a novel drift and variations of the signal
amplitude, leading to a nonlinear wave propagation. Possible applications are
in volcanic, hydrologic, hydrothermal systems as well as for deep oil drilling.
In addition, this formalism could easily be generalized for the case of a
signal arriving in a rock characterized by a steady trend of pressure and/or
temperature. These effects, being proportional to the initial conditions, can
also give velocity variations not particularly important. A further heuristic
model has therefore been analyzed, i.e. assuming a pressure dependent rock
permeability. In this way, a remarkable increase of the system velocities is
obtained.

"Modeling of fracture geometry alteration and fracture flow evolution
  under geostress and water-rock interaction","  A coupled mech-hydro-chemical model for rock geometry alteration of fractures
under water-rock interaction (WRI) and geostress is developed. Processes
including WRI, asperity deformation, mineral chemical dissolution and pressure
dissolution etc., are taken into account. A feature of this model lies in its
approximate linearization to the non-linear pressure dissolution process, which
makes this model compatible with existing numerical solute transport models.
Case study shows that although usually only a thin layer of rock surface is
invaded by WRI, the mechanical weakening of this thin layer tend to induce
significant increase in rock surface deformation. Thus, the distributed flow
field, mineral dissolution rates, and surface alteration increments etc., are
all affected. This indicates that when fracture flow related issues are
concerned, we should focus on the top thin layer of rock surface rather than
the matrix. Results also show that fluid flow enhances the dissolution of rocks
and development of flowing channels; however, at places where stress induces
high pressure-dissolution but fluid flows slowly, minerals precipitate and fill
up fracture voids. This suggests the hydraulic condition plays a key role in
the development of fracture flow channels and the evolution of fracture
geometry.

analysis of a well-known 9-story moment-resisting steel frame that is coupled

rocking walls is an efficient strategy that controls inelastic deformations by
enforcing a uniform interstory-drift distribution, therefore, avoiding
mid-story failures, the paper shows that even for medium-rise buildings the
effect of vertical tendons on the inelastic structural response is marginal,
with the exception of increasing the vertical reactions at the pivoting points
of the rocking wall. Accordingly, the paper, concludes that for medium- to
high-rise buildings vertical tendons in rocking walls are not beneficial.

"Prediction of Effective Elastic Moduli of Rocks using Graph Neural

A CNN-RNN Architecture for Multi-Label Weather Recognition,"  Weather Recognition plays an important role in our daily lives and many
computer vision applications. However, recognizing the weather conditions from
a single image remains challenging and has not been studied thoroughly.
Generally, most previous works treat weather recognition as a single-label
classification task, namely, determining whether an image belongs to a specific
weather class or not. This treatment is not always appropriate, since more than
one weather conditions may appear simultaneously in a single image. To address
this problem, we make the first attempt to view weather recognition as a
multi-label classification task, i.e., assigning an image more than one labels
according to the displayed weather conditions. Specifically, a CNN-RNN based
multi-label classification approach is proposed in this paper. The
convolutional neural network (CNN) is extended with a channel-wise attention
model to extract the most correlated visual features. The Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) further processes the features and excavates the dependencies
among weather classes. Finally, the weather labels are predicted step by step.
Besides, we construct two datasets for the weather recognition task and explore
the relationships among different weather conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The new
constructed datasets will be available at
https://github.com/wzgwzg/Multi-Label-Weather-Recognition.

"RockGPT: Reconstructing three-dimensional digital rocks from single
  two-dimensional slice from the perspective of video generation","  Random reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) digital rocks from
two-dimensional (2D) slices is crucial for elucidating the microstructure of
rocks and its effects on pore-scale flow in terms of numerical modeling, since
massive samples are usually required to handle intrinsic uncertainties. Despite
remarkable advances achieved by traditional process-based methods, statistical
approaches and recently famous deep learning-based models, few works have
focused on producing several kinds of rocks with one trained model and allowing
the reconstructed samples to satisfy certain given properties, such as
porosity. To fill this gap, we propose a new framework, named RockGPT, which is
composed of VQ-VAE and conditional GPT, to synthesize 3D samples based on a
single 2D slice from the perspective of video generation. The VQ-VAE is
utilized to compress high-dimensional input video, i.e., the sequence of
continuous rock slices, to discrete latent codes and reconstruct them. In order
to obtain diverse reconstructions, the discrete latent codes are modeled using
conditional GPT in an autoregressive manner, while incorporating conditional
information from a given slice, rock type, and porosity. We conduct two
experiments on five kinds of rocks, and the results demonstrate that RockGPT
can produce different kinds of rocks with the same model, and the reconstructed
samples can successfully meet certain specified porosities. In a broader sense,
through leveraging the proposed conditioning scheme, RockGPT constitutes an
effective way to build a general model to produce multiple kinds of rocks
simultaneously that also satisfy user-defined properties.

"Accretion of Saturn's Inner Mid-sized Moons from a Massive Primordial
  Ice Ring","  Saturn's rings are rock-poor, containing 90%-95% ice by mass. As a group,
Saturn's moons interior to and including Tethys are also about 90% ice. Tethys
itself contains <6% rock by mass, in contrast to its similar-mass outer
neighbor Dione, which contains >40% rock. Here we simulate the evolution of a
massive primordial ice-rich ring and the production of satellites as ring
material spreads beyond the Roche limit. We describe the Roche-interior ring
with an analytic model, and use an N-body code to describe material beyond the
Roche limit. We track the accretion and interactions of spawned satellites,
including tidal interaction with the planet, assuming a tidal dissipation
factor for Saturn of $Q~10^4$. We find that ring torques and capture of moons
into mutual resonances produce a system of ice-rich inner moons that extends
outward to approximately Tethys's orbit in $10^9$ years, even with relatively
slow orbital expansion due to tides. The resulting mass and semimajor axis
distribution of spawned moons resembles that of Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys.
We estimate the mass of rock delivered to the moons by external cometary
impactors during a late heavy bombardment. We find that the inner moons receive
a mass in rock comparable to their current total rock content, while Dione and
Rhea receive an order-of-magnitude less rock than their current rock content.
This suggests that external ontamination may have been the primary source of
rock in the inner moons, and that Dione and Rhea formed from much more
rock-rich source material. Reproducing the distribution of rock among the
current inner moons is challenging, and appears to require large impactors
stochasticity and/or the presence of some rock in the initial ring.

"WM-MoE: Weather-aware Multi-scale Mixture-of-Experts for Blind Adverse
  Weather Removal","  Adverse weather removal tasks like deraining, desnowing, and dehazing are
usually treated as separate tasks. However, in practical autonomous driving
scenarios, the type, intensity,and mixing degree of weather are unknown, so
handling each task separately cannot deal with the complex practical scenarios.
In this paper, we study the blind adverse weather removal problem.
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a popular model that adopts a learnable gate to
route the input to different expert networks. The principle of MoE involves
using adaptive networks to process different types of unknown inputs.
Therefore, MoE has great potential for blind adverse weather removal. However,
the original MoE module is inadequate for coupled multiple weather types and
fails to utilize multi-scale features for better performance. To this end, we
propose a method called Weather-aware Multi-scale MoE (WM-MoE) based on
Transformer for blind weather removal. WM-MoE includes two key designs:
WEather-Aware Router (WEAR) and Multi-Scale Experts (MSE). WEAR assigns experts
for each image token based on decoupled content and weather features, which
enhances the model's capability to process multiple adverse weathers. To obtain
discriminative weather features from images, we propose Weather Guidance
Fine-grained Contrastive Learning (WGF-CL), which utilizes weather cluster
information to guide the assignment of positive and negative samples for each
image token. Since processing different weather types requires different
receptive fields, MSE leverages multi-scale features to enhance the spatial
relationship modeling capability, facilitating the high-quality restoration of
diverse weather types and intensities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in blind adverse weather removal on two public datasets and our
dataset. We also demonstrate the advantage of our method on downstream
segmentation tasks.

disrupting the balance of nature. Dynamics of Arctic weather variability (WV)
plays a crucial role in weather forecasting and is closely related to extreme
weather events. Yet, assessing and quantifying the WV for both local Arctic
regions and its planetary impacts under anthropogenic climate change is still
unknown. Here, we develop a complexity-based approach to systematically
evaluate and analyze the dynamic behaviour of WV. We reveal that the WV within
and around the Arctic is statistically correlated to the Arctic Oscillation at
the intraseasonal time scale. We further find that the variability of the daily
Arctic sea ice is increasing due to its dramatic decline under a warming
climate. Unstable Arctic weather conditions can disturb regional weather
patterns through atmospheric teleconnection pathways, resulting in higher risk
to human activities and greater weather forecast uncertainty. A multivariate
climate network analysis reveals the existence of such teleconnections and
implies a positive feedback loop between the Arctic and global weather
instabilities. This enhances the mechanistic understanding of the influence of
Arctic amplification on mid-latitude severe weather. Our framework provides a
fresh perspective on the linkage of complexity science, WV and the Arctic.

MetaWeather: Few-Shot Weather-Degraded Image Restoration,"  Real-world weather conditions are intricate and often occur concurrently.
However, most existing restoration approaches are limited in their
applicability to specific weather conditions in training data and struggle to
generalize to unseen weather types, including real-world weather conditions.To
address this issue, we introduce MetaWeather, a universal approach that can
handle diverse and novel weather conditions with a single unified model.
Extending a powerful meta-learning framework, MetaWeather formulates the task
of weather-degraded image restoration as a few-shot adaptation problem that
predicts the degradation pattern of a query image, and learns to adapt to
unseen weather conditions through a novel spatial-channel matching algorithm.
Experimental results on the BID Task II.A, SPA-Data, and RealSnow datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method can adapt to unseen weather conditions,
significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art multi-weather image
restoration methods.

"Always Clear Days: Degradation Type and Severity Aware All-In-One
  Adverse Weather Removal","  All-in-one adverse weather removal is an emerging topic on image restoration,
which aims to restore multiple weather degradations in an unified model, and
the challenge are twofold. First, discover and handle the property of
multi-domain in target distribution formed by multiple weather conditions.
Second, design efficient and effective operations for different degradations.
To resolve this problem, most prior works focus on the multi-domain caused by
different weather types. Inspired by inter\&intra-domain adaptation literature,
we observe that not only weather type but also weather severity introduce
multi-domain within each weather type domain, which is ignored by previous
methods, and further limit their performance. To this end, we propose a
degradation type and severity aware model, called UtilityIR, for blind
all-in-one bad weather image restoration. To extract weather information from
single image, we propose a novel Marginal Quality Ranking Loss (MQRL) and
utilize Contrastive Loss (CL) to guide weather severity and type extraction,
and leverage a bag of novel techniques such as Multi-Head Cross Attention
(MHCA) and Local-Global Adaptive Instance Normalization (LG-AdaIN) to
efficiently restore spatial varying weather degradation. The proposed method
can outperform the state-of-the-art methods subjectively and objectively on
different weather removal tasks with a large margin, and enjoy less model
parameters. Proposed method even can restore unseen combined multiple
degradation images, and modulate restoration level. Implementation code and
pre-trained weights will be available at

Reactive-infiltration instabilities in rocks. Fracture dissolution,"  A reactive fluid dissolving the surface of a uniform fracture will trigger an
instability in the dissolution front, leading to spontaneous formation of
pronounced well-spaced channels in the surrounding rock matrix. Although the
underlying mechanism is similar to the wormhole instability in porous rocks
there are significant differences in the physics, due to the absence of a
steadily propagating reaction front. In previous work we have described the
geophysical implications of this instability in regard to the formation of long
conduits in soluble rocks. Here we describe a more general linear stability
analysis, including axial diffusion, transport limited dissolution, non-linear
kinetics, and a finite length system.

"Unsupervised machine learning for data-driven classification of rock
  mass using drilling data: How can a data-driven system handle limitations in
  existing rock mass classification systems?","  Rock mass classification systems are crucial for assessing stability and risk
in underground construction globally and guiding support and excavation design.
However, systems developed primarily in the 1970s lack access to modern
high-resolution data and advanced statistical techniques, limiting their
effectiveness as decision-support systems. Initially, we outline the
limitations observed in this context and later describe how a data-driven
system, based on drilling data as detailed in this study, can overcome these
limitations. Using extracted statistical information from thousands of MWD-data
values in one-meter sections of a full tunnel profile, thus working as a
signature of the rock mass, we have demonstrated that it is possible to form
well-defined clusters that can act as a foundational basis for various rock
mass classification systems. We reduced the dimensionality of 48-value vectors
using nonlinear manifold learning techniques (UMAP) and linear principal
component analysis (PCA) to enhance clustering. Unsupervised machine learning
methods (HDBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, K-means) were employed to cluster
the data, with hyperparameters optimised through multi-objective Bayesian
optimisation for effective clustering. Using domain knowledge, we experienced
improved clustering and system tuning opportunities in adding extra features to
core clusters of MWD-data. We structured and correlated these clusters with
physical rock mass properties, including labels of rock type and rock quality,
and analysed cumulative distributions of key MWD-parameters for rock mass
assessment to determine if clusters meaningfully differentiate rock masses. The
ability of MWD data to form distinct rock mass clusters suggests substantial
potential for future classification systems grounded in this objective,
data-driven methodology, free from human bias.

"Simulation analysis with rock muons from atmospheric neutrino
  interactions in the ICAL detector at INO","  The proposed magnetized Iron CALorimeter detector (ICAL) to be built in the
India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) laboratory aims to study atmospheric
neutrinos and its properties such as precision measurements of oscillation
parameters and the neutrino mass hierarchy. High energy charged current (CC)
interactions of atmospheric neutrinos with the rock surrounding the detector
produce so-called ""rock muons"" along with hadrons. While the hadron component
of these events are absorbed in the rock itself, the rock muons traverse the
rock and are detected in the detector. These rock muon events can be
distinguished from cosmic muons only in the upward direction and can provide an
independent measurement of the oscillation parameters. A simulation study of
these events at the ICAL detector shows that, although reduced in significance
compared to muons produced in direct CC neutrino interactions with the
detector, these events are indeed sensitive to the oscillation parameters,
achieving a possible $1\sigma$ precision of 10\% and 27\% in determining
$\Delta m_{32}^2$ and $\sin^2\theta_{23}$, respectively. Hence a combination of
the standard atmospheric neutrino analysis which is the main goal of ICAL, with
these rock muon events, will improve the precision reach of ICAL for these
parameters.

Thermal Simulation of Millimetre Wave Ablation of Geological Materials,"  This work is concerned with the numerical simulation of ablation of
geological materials using a millimetre wave source. To this end, a new
mathematical model is developed for a thermal approach to the problem, allowing
for large scale simulations, whilst being able to include the strong
temperature dependence of material parameters to ensure accurate modelling of
power input into the rock. The model presented is implemented within an
adaptive meshing framework, such that resolution can be placed where needed,
for example at the borehole wall, to further improve the computational
efficiency of large scale simulations. This approach allows for both the
heating of the rock, and the removal of evaporated material, allowing rate of
penetration and the shape of the resulting borehole to be quantified. The model
is validated against experimental results, which indicates that the approach
can accurately predict temperatures, and temperature gradients within the rock.
The validated model is then exercised to obtain initial results demonstrating
its capabilities for simulating the millimetre wave drilling process. The
effects of the conditions at the surface of the rock are investigated,
highlighting the importance of understanding the physical processes which occur
between the wave guide and the rock. Additionally, the absorptivity of the
rock, and the impact this has on the evaporation behaviour is considered.
Simulations are carried out both for isotropic rock, and also for a
multi-strata configuration. It is found that strata between similar rock types,
such as granite and basalt, absorptive properties pose little problem for
uniform drilling. However, larger variations in material parameters are shown
to have strong implications on the evaporation behaviour of the wellbore, and
hence the resulting structure.

A multi-phase thermo-mechanical model for rock-ice avalanche,"  We propose a novel physically-based multi-phase thermo-mechanical model for
rock-ice avalanche. The model is built on a multi-phase mass flow model and
extends a two-phase rock-ice avalanche model. It considers rock, ice and fluid;
includes the mechanism of ice-melting and a rigorously derived dynamically
changing general temperature equation for avalanching bulk mass, the first of
its kind. It explains advection-diffusion of heat including the heat exchange
across the rock-ice avalanche body, basal heat conduction, production and loss
of heat due to frictional shearing and changing temperature, a general
formulation of the ice melting rate and enhancement of temperature due to basal
entrainment. The temperature equation includes a composite term containing
coupled dynamics: rate of change of thermal conductivity and temperature. Ice
melt intensity determines these rates as mixture conductivity evolves,
characterizing distinctive thermo-mechanical processes. The model highlights
essential aspects of rock-ice avalanches. Lateral heat productions play an
important role in temperature evolution. Fast moving avalanches produce higher
amount of heat. Fast ice melting results in substantial change in temperature.
We formally derive the melting efficiency dependent general fluid production
rate. The model includes internal mass and momentum exchanges between the
phases and mass and momentum productions due to entrainment. The latter
significantly changes the state of temperature; yet, the former exclusively
characterizes rock-ice avalanche. Temperature changes are rapid when heat
entrainment across the avalanche boundary is substantial. It also applies to
basal heat conduction. A strong coupling exists between phase mass and momentum
balances and the temperature equation. The new model offers the first-ever
complete dynamical solution for simulating rock-ice avalanche with changing
temperature.

Temperature and rainfall determine production possibilities in both rich and
poor countries; positively in cold countries and negatively in hot ones.
Weather anomalies reduce inefficiency in rich countries but increase
inefficiency in poor and hot countries; and more so in countries with low
weather variability. The climate effect is larger that the weather effect.

"Fracturing tests on reservoir rocks: Analysis of AE events and radial

Interactive Estimation of the Fractal Properties of Carbonate Rocks,"  Scale invariance of intrinsic patterns is an important concept in geology
that can be observed in numerous geological objects and phenomena. These
geological objects and phenomena are described as containing statistically
selfsimilar patterns often modeled with fractal geometry. Fractal geometry has
been used extensively to characterize pore space and fracture distribution of
both carbonate and clastic rocks as well as the transport properties of porous
media and fluid flow in reservoirs. The fractal properties are usually
estimated from thin-section photomicrograph images or scanning electron
microscope images. For complex rock such as carbonate rocks, automatic feature
detection methods are often inaccurate. In addition, the rocks may be have been
subjected to facies selective diagenesis which preferentially affect some of
the rock fabric, thus increasing the difficulty in automatic detection of
certain features. We present an interactive program, GeoBoxCount, for analyzing
thin-section images and calculating the fractal dimension interactively. The
program relies on the geologists insight in interpreting the features of
interest; this significantly improves the accuracy of feature selection. The
program provides two options for calculating the fractal dimension: the
Hausdorff and the Minkowsi-Bouligand box-counting methods.

"Seismic Response of Yielding Structures Coupled to Rocking Walls with
  Supplemental Damping","  Given that the coupling of a framing structure to a strong, rocking wall
enforces a first-mode response, this paper investigates the dynamic response of
a yielding single-degree-of-freedom oscillator coupled to a rocking wall with
supplemental damping (hysteretic or linear viscous) along its sides. The full
nonlinear equations of motion are derived, and the study presents an earthquake
response analysis in term of inelastic spectra. The study shows that for
structures with preyielding period T1<1.0 s the effect of supplemental damping
along the sides of the rocking wall is marginal even when large values of
damping are used. The study uncovers that occasionally the damped response
matches or exceeds the undamped response; however, when this happens, the
exceedance is marginal. The paper concludes that for yielding structures with
strength less than 10% of their weight the use of supplemental damping along
the sides of a rocking wall coupled to a yielding structure is not recommended.
The paper shows that supplemental damping along the sides of the rocking wall
may have some limited beneficial effects for structures with longer preyielding
periods (say T1>1.0 s). Nevertheless, no notable further response reduction is
observed when larger values of hysteretic or viscous damping are used.

Uncertainty quantification for data-driven weather models,"  Artificial intelligence (AI)-based data-driven weather forecasting models
have experienced rapid progress over the last years. Recent studies, with
models trained on reanalysis data, achieve impressive results and demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art physics-based numerical weather
prediction models across a range of variables and evaluation metrics. Beyond
improved predictions, the main advantages of data-driven weather models are
their substantially lower computational costs and the faster generation of
forecasts, once a model has been trained. However, most efforts in data-driven
weather forecasting have been limited to deterministic, point-valued
predictions, making it impossible to quantify forecast uncertainties, which is
crucial in research and for optimal decision making in applications. Our
overarching aim is to systematically study and compare uncertainty
quantification methods to generate probabilistic weather forecasts from a
state-of-the-art deterministic data-driven weather model, Pangu-Weather.
Specifically, we compare approaches for quantifying forecast uncertainty based
on generating ensemble forecasts via perturbations to the initial conditions,
with the use of statistical and machine learning methods for post-hoc
uncertainty quantification. In a case study on medium-range forecasts of
selected weather variables over Europe, the probabilistic forecasts obtained by
using the Pangu-Weather model in concert with uncertainty quantification
methods show promising results and provide improvements over ensemble forecasts

Weather Forecasting Error in Solar Energy Forecasting,"  As renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) penetrate the power grid at

Generally, observed weather data are applied in the solar PV generation

"Weather Classification: A new multi-class dataset, data augmentation
  approach and comprehensive evaluations of Convolutional Neural Networks","  Weather conditions often disrupt the proper functioning of transportation
systems. Present systems either deploy an array of sensors or use an in-vehicle
camera to predict weather conditions. These solutions have resulted in
incremental cost and limited scope. To ensure smooth operation of all
transportation services in all-weather conditions, a reliable detection system
is necessary to classify weather in wild. The challenges involved in solving
this problem is that weather conditions are diverse in nature and there is an
absence of discriminate features among various weather conditions. The existing
works to solve this problem have been scene specific and have targeted
classification of two categories of weather. In this paper, we have created a
new open source dataset consisting of images depicting three classes of weather
i.e rain, snow and fog called RFS Dataset. A novel algorithm has also been
proposed which has used super pixel delimiting masks as a form of data
augmentation, leading to reasonable results with respect to ten Convolutional

"Kriging Methods for Modelling Spatial Basis Risk in Weather Index
  Insurances: A Technical Note","  The use of weather index insurances is subject to spatial basis risk, which
arises from the fact that the location of the user's risk exposure is not the
same as the location of any of the weather stations where an index can be
measured. To gauge the effectiveness of weather index insurances, spatial
interpolation techniques such as kriging can be adopted to estimate the
relevant weather index from observations taken at nearby locations. In this
paper, we study the performance of various statistical methods, ranging from
simple nearest neighbor to more advanced trans-Gaussian kriging, in spatial
interpolations of daily precipitations with data obtained from the US National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. We also investigate how spatial
interpolations should be implemented in practice when the insurance is linked
to popular weather indexes including annual consecutive dry days ($CDD$) and
maximum five-day precipitation in one month ($MFP$). It is found that although
spatially interpolating the raw weather variables on a daily basis is more
sophisticated and computationally demanding, it does not necessarily yield
superior results compared to direct interpolations of $CDD$/$MFP$ on a
yearly/monthly basis. This intriguing outcome can be explained by the
statistical properties of the weather indexes and the underlying weather
variables.

Language-driven All-in-one Adverse Weather Removal,"  All-in-one (AiO) frameworks restore various adverse weather degradations with
a single set of networks jointly. To handle various weather conditions, an AiO
framework is expected to adaptively learn weather-specific knowledge for
different degradations and shared knowledge for common patterns. However,
existing methods: 1) rely on extra supervision signals, which are usually
unknown in real-world applications; 2) employ fixed network structures, which
restrict the diversity of weather-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose
a Language-driven Restoration framework (LDR) to alleviate the aforementioned
issues. First, we leverage the power of pre-trained vision-language (PVL)
models to enrich the diversity of weather-specific knowledge by reasoning about
the occurrence, type, and severity of degradation, generating description-based
degradation priors. Then, with the guidance of degradation prior, we sparsely
select restoration experts from a candidate list dynamically based on a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure. This enables us to adaptively learn the
weather-specific and shared knowledge to handle various weather conditions
(e.g., unknown or mixed weather). Experiments on extensive restoration
scenarios show our superior performance (see Fig. 1). The source code will be
made available.

"STC-ViT: Spatio Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for Weather
  Forecasting","  Operational weather forecasting system relies on computationally expensive
physics-based models. Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable
potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However,
transformers are discrete models which limit their ability to learn the
continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address
this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for
weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers
with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution
over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in
the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. We evaluate
STC-ViT against a operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and
several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT performs
competitively with current data-driven methods in global forecasting while only
being trained at lower resolution data and with less compute power.

"A comparative study on machine learning approaches for rock mass
  classification using drilling data","  Current rock engineering design in drill and blast tunnelling primarily
relies on engineers' observational assessments. Measure While Drilling (MWD)
data, a high-resolution sensor dataset collected during tunnel excavation, is
underutilised, mainly serving for geological visualisation. This study aims to
automate the translation of MWD data into actionable metrics for rock
engineering. It seeks to link data to specific engineering actions, thus
providing critical decision support for geological challenges ahead of the
tunnel face. Leveraging a large and geologically diverse dataset of 500,000
drillholes from 15 tunnels, the research introduces models for accurate rock
mass quality classification in a real-world tunnelling context. Both
conventional machine learning and image-based deep learning are explored to
classify MWD data into Q-classes and Q-values, examples of metrics describing
the stability of the rock mass, using both tabular and image data. The results
indicate that the K-nearest neighbours algorithm in an ensemble with tree-based
models using tabular data, effectively classifies rock mass quality. It
achieves a cross-validated balanced accuracy of 0.86 in classifying rock mass
into the Q-classes A, B, C, D, E1, E2, and 0.95 for a binary classification
with E versus the rest. Classification using a CNN with MWD-images for each
blasting round resulted in a balanced accuracy of 0.82 for binary
classification. Regressing the Q-value from tabular MWD-data achieved
cross-validated R2 and MSE scores of 0.80 and 0.18 for a similar ensemble model
as in classification. High performance in regression and classification boosts
confidence in automated rock mass assessment. Applying advanced modelling on a
unique dataset demonstrates MWD data's value in improving rock mass
classification accuracy and advancing data-driven rock engineering design,
reducing manual intervention.

"Hedging crop yields against weather uncertainties -- a weather
  derivative perspective","  The effects of weather on agriculture in recent years have become a major
global concern. Hence, the need for an effective weather risk management tool
(i.e., weather derivatives) that can hedge crop yields against weather
uncertainties. However, most smallholder farmers and agricultural stakeholders
are unwilling to pay for the price of weather derivatives (WD) because of the
presence of basis risks (product-design and geographical) in the pricing
models. To eliminate product-design basis risks, a machine learning ensemble
technique was used to determine the relationship between maize yield and
weather variables. The results revealed that the most significant weather
variable that affected the yield of maize was average temperature. A
mean-reverting model with a time-varying speed of mean reversion, seasonal
mean, and local volatility that depended on the local average temperature was
then proposed. The model was extended to a multi-dimensional model for
different but correlated locations. Based on these average temperature models,
pricing models for futures, options on futures, and basket futures for
cumulative average temperature and growing degree-days are presented. Pricing
futures on baskets reduces geographical basis risk, as buyers have the
opportunity to select the most appropriate weather stations with their desired
weight preference. With these pricing models, farmers and agricultural
stakeholders can hedge their crops against the perils of extreme weather.

"Prototyping Low-Cost Automatic Weather Stations for Natural Disaster
  Monitoring","  Weather events put human lives at risk mostly when people might reside in
areas susceptible to natural disasters. Weather monitoring is a pivotal task
that is accomplished in vulnerable areas with the support of reliable weather
stations. Such stations are front-end equipment typically mounted on a fixed
mast structure with a set of digital and magnetic weather sensors connected to
a datalogger. While remote sensing from a number of stations is paramount, the
cost of professional weather instruments is extremely high. This imposes a
challenge for large-scale deployment and maintenance of weather stations for
broad natural disaster monitoring. To address this problem, in this paper, we
validate the hypothesis that a Low-Cost Automatic Weather Station system
(LCAWS) entirely developed from commercial-off-the-shelf and open-source IoT
technologies is able to provide data as reliable as a Professional Weather
Station (PWS) of reference for natural disaster monitoring. To achieve data
reliability, we propose an intelligent sensor calibration method to correct
weather parameters. From the experimental results of a 30-day uninterrupted
observation period, we show that the results of the calibrated LCAWS sensors
have no statistically significant differences with the PWS's results. Together
with The Brazilian National Center for Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural
Disasters (Cemaden), LCAWS has opened new opportunities towards reducing
maintenance cost of its weather observational network.

"RiWNet: A moving object instance segmentation Network being Robust in
  adverse Weather conditions","  Segmenting each moving object instance in a scene is essential for many
applications. But like many other computer vision tasks, this task performs
well in optimal weather, but then adverse weather tends to fail. To be robust
in weather conditions, the usual way is to train network in data of given
weather pattern or to fuse multiple sensors. We focus on a new possibility,
that is, to improve its resilience to weather interference through the
network's structural design. First, we propose a novel FPN structure called
RiWFPN with a progressive top-down interaction and attention refinement module.
RiWFPN can directly replace other FPN structures to improve the robustness of
the network in non-optimal weather conditions. Then we extend SOLOV2 to capture
temporal information in video to learn motion information, and propose a moving
object instance segmentation network with RiWFPN called RiWNet. Finally, in
order to verify the effect of moving instance segmentation in different weather
disturbances, we propose a VKTTI-moving dataset which is a moving instance
segmentation dataset based on the VKTTI dataset, taking into account different
weather scenes such as rain, fog, sunset, morning as well as overcast. The
experiment proves how RiWFPN improves the network's resilience to adverse
weather effects compared to other FPN structures. We compare RiWNet to several
other state-of-the-art methods in some challenging datasets, and RiWNet shows
better performance especially under adverse weather conditions.

"3D Semantic Segmentation in the Wild: Learning Generalized Models for
  Adverse-Condition Point Clouds","  Robust point cloud parsing under all-weather conditions is crucial to level-5
autonomy in autonomous driving. However, how to learn a universal 3D semantic
segmentation (3DSS) model is largely neglected as most existing benchmarks are
dominated by point clouds captured under normal weather. We introduce
SemanticSTF, an adverse-weather point cloud dataset that provides dense
point-level annotations and allows to study 3DSS under various adverse weather
conditions. We study all-weather 3DSS modeling under two setups: 1) domain
adaptive 3DSS that adapts from normal-weather data to adverse-weather data; 2)
domain generalizable 3DSS that learns all-weather 3DSS models from
normal-weather data. Our studies reveal the challenge while existing 3DSS
methods encounter adverse-weather data, showing the great value of SemanticSTF
in steering the future endeavor along this very meaningful research direction.
In addition, we design a domain randomization technique that alternatively
randomizes the geometry styles of point clouds and aggregates their embeddings,
ultimately leading to a generalizable model that can improve 3DSS under various
adverse weather effectively. The SemanticSTF and related codes are available at

GenCast: Diffusion-based ensemble forecasting for medium-range weather,"  Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of
probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the

introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed
than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, the
European Centre for Medium-Range Forecasts (ECMWF)'s ensemble forecast, ENS.
Unlike traditional approaches, which are based on numerical weather prediction
(NWP), GenCast is a machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) method, trained
on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic
15-day global forecasts, at 12-hour steps and 0.25 degree latitude-longitude
resolution, for over 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 minutes. It has
greater skill than ENS on 97.4% of 1320 targets we evaluated, and better
predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclones, and wind power production. This
work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, where
critical weather-dependent decisions are made with greater accuracy and
efficiency.

"Producing High Concentrations of Hydrogen in Palladium via
  Electrochemical Insertion from Aqueous and Solid Electrolytes","  Metal hydrides are critical materials in numerous technologies including
hydrogen storage, gas separation, and electrocatalysis. Here, using Pd-H as a
model metal hydride, we perform electrochemical insertion studies of hydrogen
via liquid and solid state electrolytes at 1 atm ambient pressure, and achieve
H:Pd ratios near unity, the theoretical solubility limit. We show that the
compositions achieved result from a dynamic balance between the rate of
hydrogen insertion and evolution from the Pd lattice, the combined kinetics of
which are sufficiently rapid that operando experiments are necessary to
characterize instantaneous PdHx composition. We use simultaneous
electrochemical insertion and X-ray diffraction measurements, combined with a
new calibration of lattice parameter versus hydrogen concentration, to enable
accurate quantification of the composition of electrochemically synthesized
PdHx. Furthermore, we show that the achievable hydrogen concentration is
severely limited by electrochemomechanical damage to the palladium and/or
substrate. The understanding embodied in these results helps to establish new
design rules for achieving high hydrogen concentrations in metal hydrides.

"Destructive Impact of Molecular Noise on Nanoscale Electrochemical
  Oscillators","  We study the loss of coherence of electrochemical oscillations on meso- and
nanosized electrodes with numeric simulations of the electrochemical master
equation for a prototypical electrochemical oscillator, the hydrogen peroxide
reduction on Pt electrodes in the presence of halides. On nanoelectrodes, the
electrode potential changes whenever a stochastic electron-transfer event takes
place. Electrochemical reaction rate coefficients depend exponentially on the
electrode potential and become thus fluctuating quantities as well. Therefore,
also the transition rates between system states become time-dependent which
constitutes a fundamental difference to purely chemical nanoscale oscillators.
Three implications are demonstrated: (a) oscillations and steady states shift
in phase space with decreasing system size, thereby also decreasing
considerably the oscillating parameter regions; (b) the minimal number of
molecules necessary to support correlated oscillations is more than 10 times as
large as for nanoscale chemical oscillators; (c) the relation between
correlation time and variance of the period of the oscillations predicted for
chemical oscillators in the weak noise limit is only fulfilled in a very

"The role of ionic liquid breakdown in the electrochemical metallization
  of VO2: An NMR study of gating mechanisms and VO2 reduction","  Metallization of initially insulating VO2 via ionic liquid electrolytes
(electrolyte gating) has recently been a topic of much interest. It is clear
that the metallization takes place electrochemically and there has previously
been extensive evidence for the removal of small amounts of oxygen during ionic
liquid gating. Hydrogen intercalation has also been proposed, but the source of
the hydrogen has remained unclear. In this work, solid-state magic angle
spinning NMR spectroscopy is used to investigate the thermal metal-insulator
transition in VO2, before progressing to catalytically hydrogenated and
electrochemically metallized VO2. Electrochemical metallization of bulk VO2
particles is shown to be associated with intercalation of hydrogen, the degree
of which can be measured with quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy. Possible
sources of the hydrogen are explored, and by using a selectively deuterated
ionic liquid, it is revealed that the hydrogenation is due to deprotonation of
the ionic liquid; specifically, for the commonly used dialkylimidazolium based
ionic liquids, it is the ""carbene"" proton that is responsible. Increasing the
temperature of the electrochemistry is shown to increase the degree of
hydrogenation, forming first a less hydrogenated metallic phase then a more
hydrogenated insulating Curie-Weiss paramagnetic phase, both of which were also
observed for catalytically hydrogenated VO2. The NMR results are supported by
magnetic susceptibility measurements, which corroborate the degree of Pauli and
Curie-Weiss paramagnetism. NMR spectroscopy is used to identify the presence of
hydrogen in an electrolyte gated thin film of VO2, suggesting that electrolyte
breakdown, proton intercalation and reactions with decomposition products
within the electrolyte should not be ignored when interpreting the electronic
and structural changes observed in electrochemical gating experiments.

"Comparison of hydrogen diffusivities measured by electrochemical
  permeation and temperature-programmed desorption in cold-rolled pure iron","  The diffusivity of hydrogen in cold-rolled pure iron is investigated using
permeation and desorption methods. Electrochemical charging, electro-permeation
and thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) experiments are conducted. Firstly,
the relation between the charging current and the hydrogen concentration is
established. Secondly, permeation experiments are conducted at 22, 40 and
67{\deg}C to quantify the diffusivity dependence on temperature. Finally, the
diffusivity is estimated by using two types of desorption experiments and
Fick's law: (i) a `rest time' method, by which we measure the hydrogen content
of samples held at room temperature for different times, and (ii) isothermal
desorption experiments at temperatures ranging from 22 to 80{\deg}C, fitting
the resulting desorption rate versus time curves. Good agreement is obtained
between the isothermal desorption and permeation approaches, with observed
differences discussed and rationalised. Moreover, measured diffusivity values
for cold-rolled pure iron are also found to be comparable to those reported in
the literature. This work demonstrates that isothermal desorption experiments
are a convenient approach to determine hydrogen diffusivity over a wide range
of temperatures, as facilitated by new TDS systems with fast heating rates.

"Nonthermal Atmospheric Plasma Reactors for Hydrogen Production from
  Low-Density Polyethylene","  Hydrogen is largely produced via natural gas reforming or electrochemical
water-splitting, leaving organic solid feedstocks under-utilized. Plasma
technology powered by renewable electricity can lead to the sustainable
upcycling of plastic waste and production of green hydrogen. In this work,
low-temperature atmospheric pressure plasma reactors based on transferred arc

transarc and glidarc reactors, respectively. For the transarc reactor, smaller
electrode-feedstock spacing favors greater hydrogen production, whereas, for
the glidarc reactor, greater hydrogen production is obtained at intermediate

"Doped-MoSe2 nanoflakes/3d metal oxide-hydr(oxy)oxides hybrid catalysts
  for pH-universal electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction","  Clean hydrogen production through efficient and cost-effective
electrochemical water splitting is highly promising to meeting future global
energy demands. The design of Earth-abundant materials with both high activity
for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrochemical stability in both
acidic and alkaline environments summarize the outcomes needed for practical
applications. Here, we report a non-noble 3d metal Cl-chemical doping of liquid
phase exfoliated single/few-layer flakes of MoSe2 for creating MoSe2
nanoflakes/3d metal oxide-hydr(oxy)oxide hybrid HER-catalysts. We propose that
the electron-transfer from MoSe2 nanoflakes to metal cations and the chlorine
complexation-induced both neutralization, as well as the in situ formation of
metal oxide-hydr(oxy)oxides on MoSe2 nanoflake's surface, tailor the proton

their active sites in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The
electrochemical coupling between the doped-MoSe2 nanoflakes/metal
oxide-hydr(oxy)oxide hybrids and single-walled carbon nanotubes
heterostructures further accelerates the HER process. Lastly, monolithic
stacking of multiple heterostructures is reported as a facile electrode
assembly strategy to achieve overpotential for a cathodic current density of

"Electrochemical characterisation of ionic dynamics resulting from spin
  conversion of water isomers","  Para- and ortho- isomers of water have different chemical and physical
properties. Excitations by magnetic field, laser emission or hydrodynamic
cavitation are reported to change energetic levels and spin configurations of
water molecules that in turn change macroscopically measurable properties of
aqueous solutions. Similar scheme is also explored for dissolved molecular
oxygen, where physical excitations form singlet oxygen with different spin
configurations and generate a long chain of ionic and free-radical reactions.
This work utilizes electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to characterize
ionic dynamics of proposed spin conversion methods applied to dissolving of
carbon dioxide CO$_2$ and hydrogen peroxide H$_2$O$_2$ in pure water excited by
fluctuating weak magnetic field in uT range. Measurement results demonstrate
different ionic reactivities and surface tension effects triggered by
excitations at 10$^{-8}$J/mL. The CO$_2$- and O$_2$-related reaction pathways
are well distinguishable by EIS. Control experiments without CO$_2$/H$_2$O$_2$

temperature of fluids indicates anomalous quasi-periodical fluctuations
pointing to possible carbonate-induced cyclic reactions or cyclical spin

"Improved in-situ characterization of electrochemical interfaces using
  metasurface-driven surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy","  Electrocatalysis plays a crucial role in realizing the transition towards
green energy, driving research directions from hydrogen generation to carbon
dioxide reduction. Understanding electrochemical reactions is crucial to
improve their efficiency and to bridge the gap toward a sustainable zero-carbon
future. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) is a
suitable method for investigating these processes because it can monitor with
chemical specificity the mechanisms of the reactions. However, it remains
difficult to detect many relevant aspects of electrochemical reactions such as
short-lived intermediates. Here, we develop and experimentally realize an
integrated nanophotonic-electrochemical SEIRAS platform for the in situ
investigation of molecular signal traces emerging during electrochemical
experiments. Specifically, we implement a platinum nano-slot metasurface
featuring strongly enhanced electromagnetic near fields and spectrally target
it at the weak vibrational bending mode of adsorbed CO at ~2033 cm-1.
Crucially, our platinum nano-slot metasurface provides high molecular
sensitivity. The resonances can be tuned over a broad range in the mid-infrared
spectrum. Compared to conventional unstructured platinum layers, our
nanophotonic-electrochemical platform delivers a substantial improvement of the
experimentally detected characteristic absorption signals by a factor of 27,
enabling the detection of new species with weak signals, fast conversions, or

"Hydrogen-induced hardening of a high-manganese twinning induced
  plasticity steel","  High-manganese twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steels exhibit high strain
hardening, high tensile strength, and high ductility, which make them
attractive for structural applications. At low tensile strain rates, TWIP
steels are prone to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Here though, we study the
hardening and strengthening resulting from electrochemical hydrogen-charging of
a surface layer of a Fe-26.9Mn-0.28C (wt.%) TWIP steel. We observed a 20%
increase in yield strength following the electrochemical hydrogen-charging,
accompanied by a reduction in ductility from 75% to 10% at a tensile strain
rate of 10-3s-1. The microstructural evolution during tensile deformation was
examined at strain levels of 3%, 5% and 7% by electron backscatter diffraction
(EBSD) and electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) to study the dislocation
structure of the hardened region. As expected, the microstructure of the
hydrogen-hardened and the uncharged regions of the material evolve differently.
The uncharged areas show entangled dislocation structures, indicating slip from
a limited number of potentially coplanar slip systems. In contrast, hydrogen
segregated to the grain boundaries, revealed by the deuterium-labelled atom
probe tomography, delays the dislocation nucleation by blocking dislocation
sources at the grain boundaries. The charged areas hence first show the
formation of cells, indicating dislocation entanglement from more non-coplanar
slip systems. With increasing strain, these cells dissolve, and stacking faults
and strain-induced {\epsilon}-martensite are formed, promoted by the presence
of hydrogen. The influence of hydrogen on dislocation structures and the
overall deformation mechanism is discussed in details.

"Virtual Breakdown Mechanism: Field-Driven Splitting of Pure Water for

pure water splitting exhibits a completely different mechanism from the

of the equivalent conductivity of pure water. This fundamental discovery has
been theoretically discussed in this paper and experimentally demonstrated in a

"Prediction Of A Multi-Center Bonded Solid Boron Hydride for Hydrogen
  Storage","  An ideal material for on-board hydrogen storage must release hydrogen at
practical temperature and pressure and also regenerate efficiently under
similarly gentle conditions. Therefore, thermodynamically, the hydride material
must lie within a narrow range near the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation phase
boundary. Materials involving only conventional bonding mechanisms are unlikely
to meet these requirements. In contrast, materials containing certain
frustrated bonding are designed to be on the verge of frustration-induced phase
transition, and they may be better suited for hydrogen storage. Here we propose
a novel layered solid boron hydride and show its potential for hydrogen
storage. The absence of soft phonon modes confirms the dynamical stability of
the structure. Charging the structure significantly softens hydrogen-related
phonon modes. Boron-related phonons, in contrast, are either hardened or not
significantly affected by electron doping. These results suggest that
electrochemical charging may facilitate hydrogen release while the underlying
boron network remains intact for subsequent rehydrogenation.

Enhancing Microgrid Resilience with Green Hydrogen Storage,"  We consider the problem of hydrogen storage integration in microgrids to

electrochemical models of electrolyzers and fuel cells for hydrogen storage are
considered, making scheduling under the nonlinear model intractable and the
conventional linear approximation infeasible. A piecewise linear model
approximation with feasibility projection is proposed, resulting in a
computationally efficient model predictive control for hydrogen storage

decades. Understanding hydrogen diffusion behavior in steels is crucial towards
both developing predictive models for hydrogen embrittlement and identifying

extremely challenging to detect by most analytical methods. In recent years,
cryogenic-transfer atom probe tomography (APT) of
electrochemically-deuterium-charged steels has provided invaluable qualitative
analysis of nanoscale deuterium traps such as carbides, dislocations, grain

quantitative analysis of deuterium pickup in electrolytically charged pure Fe

"How Metal/Insulator Interfaces Enable the Enhancement of the Hydrogen
  Evolution Reaction Kinetics in Two Ways","  Laterally nanostructured surfaces give rise to a new dimension of
understanding and improving electrochemical reactions. In this study, we
present a peculiar mechanism appearing at a metal/insulator interface, which
can significantly enhance the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) from water
reduction by altering the local reaction conditions in two ways: facilitated
adsorption of hydrogen on the metal catalyst surface and improved transfer of
ions through the double layer. The mechanism is uncovered using electrodes
consisting of well-defined nanometer-sized metal arrays (Au, Cu, Pt) embedded
in an insulator layer (silicon nitride), varying various parameters of both the
electrode (size of the metal patches, catalyst material) and the electrolyte
(cationic species, cation concentration, pH). In addition, simulations of the
electrochemical double layer are carried out, which support the elaborated
mechanism. Knowledge of this mechanism will enable new design principles for
novel composite electrocatalytic systems.

"electrochemically modeling a non-electrochemical system: hydrogen
  peroxide direct synthesis on palladium catalysts","  Nonelectrochemical hydrogen peroxide direct synthesis (HPDS) under ambient
conditions is an environmentally benign and energy-efficient process that
produces a green oxidizer. Despite its industrial importance, the reaction
mechanism of HPDS is still controversial, even for the prototypical catalyst
Pd. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a comprehensive
consideration of entropic and solvation effects reveal that the conventionally
accepted Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism fails to explain why H2O2 production
dominates over H2O production, which was experimentally reported. Inspired by
the recently suggested heterolytic mechanism that involves electron and proton
transfer at Pd catalysts, we propose a new electrochemical DFT model that is
applicable for nonelectrochemical systems where a protonation intrinsically
occurs. Our model is based on combining the Butler-Volmer equation and constant
potential DFT with hybrid explicit-implicit solvent treatments. Application of
this model to Pd(111) surfaces produces accurate descriptions of the activation
barriers of both H2O2 and H2O production (within only ~0.1 eV of experimentally
measured values). The heterolytic mechanism has a lower barrier for the
protonation steps for H2O2 production than the nonelectrochemical hydrogenation
steps, leading to advantageous kinetics for H2O2 production over H2O
production. This work is the first theoretical and computational study
supporting the heterolytic H2O2 production mechanism, and it resolves the
unanswered discrepancies between previous experimental and DFT results. We
expect that these results will readily help the systematic development of
improved catalysts for H2O2 synthesis.

Valorizing the carbon byproduct of methane pyrolysis in batteries,"  While low-cost natural gas remains abundant, the energy content of this fuel
can be utilized without greenhouse gas emissions through the production of
molecular hydrogen and solid carbon via methane pyrolysis. In the absence of a
carbon tax, methane pyrolysis is not economically competitive with current
hydrogen production methods unless the carbon byproducts can be valorized. In
this work, we assess the viability of the carbon byproduct produced from
methane pyrolysis in molten salts as high-value-added anode or conductive
additive for secondary Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Raman characterization and
electrochemical differential capacity analysis demonstrate that the use of
molten salt mixtures with catalytically-active FeCl3- or MnCl2 result in more
graphitic carbon co-products. These graphitic carbons exhibit the best
electrochemical performance (up to 272 mAh/g of reversible capacity) when used
as Li-ion anodes. For all carbon samples studied here, disordered carbon
domains and retained salt species trapped and/or intercalated into the carbon
structure were identified by X-ray photoelectron and multinuclear solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The latter lead to reduced
electrochemical activity and reversibility, and poorer rate performance
compared to commercial carbon anodes. The electronic conductivity of the
pyrolyzed carbons is found to be highly dependent on their purity, with the
purest carbon exhibiting an electronic conductivity nearly on par with that of
commercial carbon additives. These findings suggest that more effective removal
of the salt catalyst could enable applications of these carbons in secondary
batteries, providing a financial incentive for the large-scale implementation
of methane pyrolysis for low-carbon hydrogen production.

"Impact of surface treatments on the electron affinity of nitrogen-doped
  ultrananocrystalline diamond","  In recent years, various forms of nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) have emerged
as an attractive group of diamond/graphite mixed-phase materials for a range of
applications from electron emission sources to electrodes for neural
interfacing. To tailor their properties for different uses, NCD surfaces can be
terminated with various chemical functionalities, in particular hydrogen and
oxygen, which shift the band edge positions and electron affinity values. While
the band edge positions of chemically terminated single crystal diamond are
well understood, the same is not true for nanocrystalline diamond, which has
uncontrolled crystallographic surfaces with a variety of chemical states as
well as graphitic grain boundary regions. In this work, the relative band edge
positions of as-grown, hydrogen terminated, and oxygen terminated
nitrogen-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond (N-UNCD) are determined using
ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), while the band bending is
investigated using photoelectrochemical measurements. In contrast to the widely
reported negative electrode affinity of hydrogen terminated single crystal
diamond, our work demonstrates that hydrogen terminated N-UNCD exhibits a
positive electron affinity owing to the increased surface and bulk defect
densities. These findings elucidate the marked differences in electrochemical
properties of hydrogen and oxygen terminated N-UNCD, such as the dramatic
changes in electrochemical capacitance.

"Scalable and efficient separation of hydrogen isotopes using

"Comparative study of hydrogen embrittlement resistance between
  additively and conventionally manufactured austenitic stainless steels","  Hydrogen embrittlement in 304L (18wt.% Cr, 8-10wt.% Ni) austenitic stainless
steel (ASS) fabricated by laser powder-bed-fusion (LPBF) was investigated by
tensile testing after electrochemical hydrogen pre-charging and compared to
conventionally available 304L ASSs with two different processing histories, (i)
casting plus annealing (CA) and (ii) CA plus thermomechanical treatment (TMT).
It was revealed that hydrogen-charging led to a significant reduction in
ductility for the CA sample, but only a small effect of hydrogen was observed
for the LPBF and CA-TMT samples. Hydrogen-assisted cracking behavior was found
to be strongly linked to strain-induced martensitic transformation. In
addition, the amount of alpha' martensite was much higher in the CA sample than
in other samples, suggesting that severe hydrogen embrittlement can be
correlated with the low mechanical stability of austenite. Detailed
microstructural characterization showed that low austenite stability of the CA
sample was mainly attributed to the retained content of delta ferrite and the
chemical inhomogeneity inside the gamma matrix (gamma close to delta has ~2
wt.% higher Cr but ~2 wt.% lower Ni), but TMT enhanced the chemical homogeneity
and thus austenite stability. By contrast, the LPBF process led directly, i.e.
without any thermomechanical treatment, to a fully austenitic structure with
homogeneous elemental distribution in the ASS. These results confirmed that the
presence of delta and the chemical inhomogeneity inside gamma matrix, which
promoted the deformation-induced martensitic transformation and the associated
H enrichment at the gamma-alpha' interface, was the primary reason for the
severe H-assisted failure.

Proton polarons in HxWO3 by synchrotron photoemission and DFT modelling,"  The measurement of hydrogen induced changes on the electronic structure of
transition metal oxides by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is a challenging
endeavor, since the origin of the photoelectron cannot be unambiguously
assigned to hydrogen. The H-induced electronic structure changes in tungsten
trioxide have been known for more than 100 years, but are still being
controversially debated. The controversy stems from the difficulty in
disentangling effects due to hydrogenation from the effects of oxygen
deficiencies. Using a membrane approach to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in
combination with tuneable synchrotron radiation we measure simultaneously core
levels and valence band up to a hydrogen pressure of 1000 mbar. Upon
hydrogenation, the intensities of the W$^{5+}$ core level and a state close to
the Fermi level increase following the pressure-composition isotherm curve of
bulk H$_x$WO$_3$. Combining experimental data and density-functional theory the
description of the hydrogen induced coloration by a proton polaron model is
corroborated. Although hydrogen is the origin of the electronic structure
changes near the Fermi edge, the valence band edge is now dominated by tungsten
orbitals instead of oxygen as is the case for the pristine oxide having wider
implication for its use as (photo-electrochemical) catalyst.

"Nonlinear, electrocatalytic swimming in the presence of salt","  A small, bimetallic particle in a hydrogen peroxide solution can propel
itself by means of an electrocatalytic reaction. The swimming is driven by a
flux of ions around the particle. We model this process for the presence of a
monovalent salt, where reaction-driven proton currents induce salt ion
currents. A theory for thin diffuse layers is employed, which yields nonlinear,
coupled transport equations. The boundary conditions include a compact Stern
layer of adsorbed ions. Electrochemical processes on the particle surface are
modeled with a first order reaction of the Butler-Volmer type. The equations
are solved numerically for the swimming speed. An analytical approximation is
derived under the assumption that the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide occurs
mainly without inducing an electric current. We find that the swimming speed
increases linearly with hydrogen peroxide concentration for small
concentrations. The influence of ion diffusion on the reaction rate can lead to
a concave shape of the function of speed vs. hydrogen peroxide concentration.
The compact layer of ions on the particle diminishes the reaction rate and
consequently reduces the speed. Our results are consistent with published
experimental data.

and cost-effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).
However, only the edge sites of their trigonal prismatic phase show
HER-electrocatalytic properties, while the basal plane, which is absent of
defective/unsaturated sites, is inactive. Here, we tackle the key challenge
that is increasing the number of electrocatalytic sites by designing and
engineering heterostructures composed of single-/few-layer MoSe2 flakes and
carbon nanomaterials (graphene or single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs))
produced by solution processing. The electrochemical coupling between the
materials that comprise the heterostructure effectively enhances the
HER-electrocatalytic activity of the native MoSe2 flakes. The optimization of
the mass loading of MoSe2 flakes and their electrode assembly via monolithic

Subsequently, we have observed no significant difference in the reaction

"A Theoretical Study of Aqueous Humor Secretion Based on a Continuum
  Model Coupling Electrochemical and Fluid-Dynamical Transmembrane Mechanisms","  Intraocular pressure, resulting from the balance of aqueous humor (AH)
production and drainage, is the only approved treatable risk factor in
glaucoma. AH production is determined by the concurrent function of ionic pumps
and aquaporins in the ciliary processes but their individual contribution is
difficult to characterize experimentally. In this work, we propose a novel
unified modeling and computational framework for the finite element simulation
of the role of the main ionic pumps involved in AH secretion, namely, the
sodium potassium pump, the calcium-sodium pump, the anion channel and the
hydrogenate-sodium pump. The theoretical model is developed at the cellular
scale and is based on the coupling between electrochemical and fluid-dynamical
transmembrane mechanisms characterized by a novel description of the electric
pressure exerted by the ions on the intrachannel fluid that includes
electrochemical and osmotic corrections. Considering a realistic geometry of
the ionic pumps, the proposed model is demonstrated to correctly predict their
functionality as a function of (1) the permanent electric charge density over
the channel pump surface; (2) the osmotic gradient coefficient; (3) the
stoichiometric ratio between the ionic pump currents enforced at the inlet and
outlet sections of the channel. In particular, theoretical predictions of the
transepithelial membrane potential for each simulated pump/channel allow us to
perform a first significant model comparison with experimental data for
monkeys. This is a significant step for future multidisciplinary studies on the
action of molecules on AH production.

Electrochemical membrane microactuator with a millisecond response time,"  Lack of fast and strong actuators to drive microsystems is well recognized.
Electrochemical actuators are considered attractive for many applications but
they have long response time (minutes) due to slow gas termination. Here an
electrochemical actuator is presented for which the response time can be as
short as 1 ms. The alternating polarity water electrolysis is used to drive the
device. In this process only nanobubbles are formed. The gas in nanobubbles can
be terminated fast due to surface assisted reaction between hydrogen and oxygen
that happens at room temperature. The working chamber of the actuator contains
concentric titanium electrodes; it has a diameter of 500 um and a height of 8
um. The chamber is sealed by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane of 30 um
thick. The device is characterized by an interferometer and a fast camera.
Cyclic operation at frequency up to 667 Hz with a stroke of about 30% of the
chamber volume is demonstrated. The cycles repeat themselves with high
precision providing the volume strokes in picoliter range. Controlled
explosions in the chamber can push the membrane up to 90 um.

"PEMNET: A Transfer Learning-based Modeling Approach of High-Temperature
  Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Electrochemical Systems","  Widespread adoption of high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
cells (HT-PEMFCs) and HT-PEM electrochemical hydrogen pumps (HT-PEM ECHPs)
requires models and computational tools that provide accurate scale-up and
optimization. Knowledge-based modeling has limitations as it is time consuming
and requires information about the system that is not always available (e.g.,
material properties and interfacial behavior between different materials).
Data-driven modeling on the other hand, is easier to implement, but often
necessitates large datasets that could be difficult to obtain. In this
contribution, knowledge-based modeling and data-driven modeling are uniquely
combined by implementing a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) approach. A knowledge-based
model originally developed for a HT-PEMFC was used to generate simulated data
(887,735 points) and used to pretrain a neural network source model.
Furthermore, the source model developed for HT-PEMFCs was successfully applied
to HT-PEM ECHPs - a different electrochemical system that utilizes similar
materials to the fuel cell. Experimental datasets from both HT-PEMFCs and
HT-PEM ECHPs with different materials and operating conditions (~50 points
each) were used to train 8 target models via FSL. Models for the unseen data
reached high accuracies in all cases (rRMSE between 1.04 and 3.73% for HT-PEMCs

"Voltage-dependent first-principles simulation of insertion of chloride
  ions into Al/Al$_2$O$_3$ interfaces using the Quantum Continuum Approximation","  Experiments have shown that pitting corrosion can develop in aluminum
surfaces at potentials $> -0.5$ V relative to the standard hydrogen electrode
(SHE). Until recently, the onset of pitting corrosion in aluminum has not been
rigorously explored at an atomistic scale because of the difficulty of
incorporating a voltage into density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We
introduce the Quantum Continuum Approximation (QCA) which self-consistently
couples explicit DFT calculations of the metal-insulator and insulator-solution
interfaces to continuum Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatic distributions
describing the bulk of the insulating region. By decreasing the number of atoms
necessary to explicitly simulate with DFT by an order of magnitude, QCA makes
the first-principles prediction of the voltage of realistic electrochemical
interfaces feasible. After developing this technique, we apply QCA to predict
the formation energy of chloride atoms inserting into oxygen vacancies in
Al(111)/$\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ (0001) interfaces as a function of applied
voltage. We predict that chloride insertion is only favorable in systems with a
grain boundary in the Al$_2$O$_3$ for voltages $> -0.2$ V (SHE). Our results
roughly agree with the experimentally demonstrated onset of corrosion,
demonstrating QCA's utility in modeling realistic electrochemical systems at
reasonable computational cost.

"Niobium disulphide (NbS$_2$)-based (heterogeneous) electrocatalysts for
  an efficient hydrogen evolution reaction","  The design of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) is the key for molecular hydrogen (H2) production from
electrochemical water splitting. Transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2), most
notably group-6 MX2 (e.g., MoS2 and WS2), are appealing catalysts for the HER
alternative to the best, but highly expensive, Pt-group elements. However,
their HER activity is typically restricted to their edge sites rather than
their basal plane. Furthermore, their semiconducting properties hinder an
efficient electron transfer to the catalytic sites, which impedes a high rate
of H2 production. Herein, we exploit liquid-phase exfoliation-produced metallic
(1H, 2H and 3R) NbS2 nanoflakes, belonging to the class of metallic layered
group-5 MX2, to overcome the abovementioned limitations. Both chemical
treatment with hygroscopic Li salt and electrochemical in operando
self-nanostructuring are exploited to improve the NbS2 nanoflake HER activity.
The combination of NbS2 with other MX2, in our case MoSe2, also provides
heterogeneous catalysts accelerating the HER kinetics of the individual
counterparts. The designed NbS2-based catalysts exhibit an overpotential at a
cathodic current of 10 mA cm-2 (n10) as low as 0.10 and 0.22 V vs. RHE in 0.5 M
H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the HER activity of the
NbS2-based catalysts is also superior to those of the Pt/C benchmark at current
densities higher than 80 mA cm-2. Our work provides general guidelines for a
scalable and cost-effective exploitation of NbS2, as well as the entire MX2
portfolio, for attaining a viable H2 production through electrochemical routes.

Oxidation effects on graded porous silicon anti-reflection coatings,"  Efficient anti-reflection coatings (ARC) improve the light collection and
thereby increase the current output of solar cells. By simple electrochemical
etching of the Si wafer, porous silicon (PS) layers with excellent broadband
anti-reflection properties can be fabricated. In this work, ageing of graded PS
has been studied using Spectroscopic Ellipsometry, Transmission Electron
Microscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. During oxidation of PS
elements such as pure Si (Si$^0$), Si$_2$O (Si$^+$), SiO (Si$^{2+}$),
Si$_2$O$_3$ (Si$^{3+}$), and SiO$_2$ (Si$^{4+}$) are present. In addition both
hydrogen and carbon is introduced to the PS in the form of Si$_3$SiH and CO.
The oxide grows almost linearly with time when exposed to oxygen, from an
average thickness of 0 - 3.8 nm for the surface PS. The oxidation is then
correlated to the optical stability of multi-layered PS ARCs. It is found that
even after extensive oxidation, the changes in the optical properties of the PS
structures are small.

The Dynamics of Platinum Precipitation in an Ion Exchange Membrane,"  Microscopy of polymer electrolyte membranes that have undergone operation
under fuel cell conditions, have revealed a well defined band of platinum in
the membrane. Here, we propose a physics based model that captures the
mechanism of platinum precipitation in the polymer electrolyte membrane. While
platinum is observed throughout the membrane, the preferential growth of
platinum at the band of platinum is dependent on the electrochemical potential
distribution in the membrane. In this paper, the location of the platinum band
is calculated as a function of the gas concentration at the cathode and anode,
gas diffusion coefficients and solubility constants of the gases in the
membrane, which are functions of relative humidity. Under H2/N2 conditions the
platinum band is located near the cathode-membrane interface, as the oxygen
concentration in the cathode gas stream increases and/or the hydrogen
concentration in the anode gas stream decreases, the band moves towards the
anode. The model developed in this paper agrees with the set of experimental
data on the platinum band location and the platinum particle distribution and
size.

"Observation of Kinetic Isotope Effect in Electrocatalysis with Fully
  Deuterated Ultrapure Electrolytes","  Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is a common physicochemical effect to elucidate
complicated microscopic reaction mechanism in biological, chemical and physical
systems. Especially, the exchange of hydrogen to deuterium is a standard
approach to investigate kinetics and pathways of a wide spectrum of key
reactions involving proton transfer. However, KIE in electrocatalysis is still
challenge. One main reason is owing to the high sensitivity to impurities in
electrochemical systems. Aiming to establish an appropriate approach to observe
KIE in electrocatalysis, we investigated KIE in electrocatalysis by using fully
deuterated ultrapure electrolytes. With these electrolytes, we studied oxygen
reduction reaction with platinum catalyst, which is well-known to be sensitive
to impurity, as the model systems. In conclusion, the electrode processes in
these systems can be strongly influenced by a purity of a selected deuterated
electrolyte, especially in case of alkaline conditions. Therefore a highly pure
deuterated electrolyte is indispensable to study microscopic electrode
processes of electrocatalysis by analyzing KIE. This work shows a key criterion
and methods to observe a reliable KIE in electrocatalytic systems, and
therefore, provides a general approach to investigate complicated
multielectron- and multiproton-transfer processes using not only standard

Titration in Canonical and Grand-Canonical Ensembles,"  We discuss problems associated with the notion of pH in heterogeneous
systems. For homogeneous systems, standardization protocols lead to a well
defined quantity, which although different from S\o rensen's original idea of
pH, is well reproducible and has become accepted as the measure of the
``hydrogen potential"". On the other hand, for heterogeneous systems, pH defined
in terms of the chemical part of the electrochemical activity is
thermodynamically inconsistent and runs afoul of the Gibbs-Guggenheim principle
that forbids splitting of the electrochemical potential into separate chemical
and electrostatic parts -- since only the sum of two has any thermodynamic
meaning. The problem is particularly relevant for modern simulation methods
which involve charge regulation of proteins, polyelectrolytes, nanoparticles,
colloidal suspensions etc. In this paper we show that titration isotherms
calculated using semi-grand canonical simulations can be very different from

"Laser-induced periodic surface structured electrodes with a 45 % energy
  saving in electrochemical fuel generation through field localization","  Electrochemical oxidation-reduction of radicals is a green and
environmentally friendly approach to generating fuels. These reactions,
however, suffer from sluggish kinetics due to a low local concentration of
radicals around the electrocatalyst. A large electrode potential can enhance
the fuel generation efficiency via enhancing the radical concentration around
the electrocatalyst sites, but this comes at the cost of electricity. Here, we
report about a 45 percent saving in energy to achieve an electrochemical
hydrogen generation rate of 10 mA per cm2 through localized electric
field-induced enhancement in the reagent concentration (LEFIRC) at
laser-induced periodic surface structured (LIPSS) electrodes. The finite
element model is used to simulate the spatial distribution of the electric
field to understand the effects of LIPSS geometric parameters in field
localization. When the LIPSS patterned electrodes are used as substrates to
support Pt-C and RuO2 electrocatalysts, the overpotentials for HER and OER are
decreased by 40 and 25 percent, respectively. Moreover, the capability of the

"Analysis of hydrogen permeation tests considering two different
  modelling approaches for grain boundary trapping in iron","  The electrochemical permeation test is one of the most used methods for
characterising hydrogen diffusion in metals. The flux of hydrogen atoms
registered in the oxidation cell might be fitted to obtain apparent
diffusivities. The magnitude of this coefficient has a decisive influence on
the kinetics of fracture or fatigue phenomena assisted by hydrogen and depends
largely on hydrogen retention in microstructural traps. In order to improve the
numerical fitting of diffusion coefficients, a permeation test has been
reproduced using FEM simulations considering two approaches: a continuum 1D
model in which the trap density, binding energy and the input lattice
concentrations are critical variables and a polycrystalline model where
trapping at grain boundaries is simulated explicitly including a segregation
factor and a diffusion coefficient different from that of the interior of the
grain. Results show that the continuum model captures trapping delay, but it
should be modified to model the trapping influence on the steady state flux.
Permeation behaviour might be classified according to different regimes
depending on deviation from Fickian diffusion. Polycrystalline synthetic
permeation shows a strong influence of segregation on output flux magnitude.
This approach is able to simulate also the short-circuit diffusion phenomenon.
The comparison between different grain sizes and grain boundary thicknesses by

PdCoO2 is of great current interest, and there is some evidence that electrons
behave like a fluid when flowing in bulk crystals of PdCoO2. Thus, this
material is an ideal platform for the study of the electron transfer processes
in heterogeneous reactions. Here, we report the use of bulk single crystal
PdCoO2 as a promising electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs).
An overpotential of only 31 mV results in a current density of 10 mA cm^(-2),
accompanied by high long-term stability. We have precisely determined that the
crystal surface structure is modified after electrochemical activation with the
formation of strained Pd nanoclusters in the surface layer. These nanoclusters
exhibit reversible hydrogen sorption and desorption, creating more active sites
for hydrogen access. The bulk PdCoO2 single crystal with ultra-high

"Solute hydrogen and deuterium observed at the near atomic scale in
  high-strength steel","  Observing solute hydrogen (H) in matter is a formidable challenge, yet,
enabling quantitative imaging of H at the atomic-scale is critical to
understand its deleterious influence on the mechanical strength of many
metallic alloys that has resulted in many catastrophic failures of engineering
parts and structures. Here, we report on the APT analysis of hydrogen (H) and
deuterium (D) within the nanostructure of an ultra-high strength steel with
high resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. Cold drawn, severely deformed
pearlitic steel wires (Fe-0.98C-0.31Mn-0.20Si-0.20Cr-0.01Cu-0.006P-0.007S wt.%,
{\epsilon}=3.1) contains cementite decomposed during the pre-deformation of the
alloy and ferrite. We find H and D within the decomposed cementite, and at some
interfaces with the surrounding ferrite. To ascertain the origin of the H/D
signal obtained in APT, we explored a series of experimental workflows
including cryogenic specimen preparation and cryogenic-vacuum transfer from the
preparation into a state-of-the-art atom probe. Our study points to the
critical role of the preparation, i.e. the possible saturation of H-trapping
sites during electrochemical polishing, how these can be alleviated by the use
of an outgassing treatment, cryogenic preparation and transfer prior to
charging. Accommodation of large amounts of H in the under-stoichiometric
carbide likely explains the resistance of pearlite against hydrogen
embrittlement.

using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and electrochemical
diagnostic techniques such as cyclic voltammetry and rotating ring-disk

potential of electroreduction of oxygen in 0.5 mol dm-3 H2SO4 (under rotating

polynuclear cyanoferrate modifier, the amounts of the undesirable hydrogen

high-current-density HER. Noteworthy, production rate of this MoS2-based
catalyst is one to two orders of magnitude higher than those previously

"On the product selectivity in the electrochemical reductive cleavage of
  lignin model compounds","  Research towards the production of renewable chemicals for fuel and energy
industries has found lignin valorization as key. With a high carbon content and
aromaticity, a fine-tuning of the depolymerization process is required to
convert lignin into valuable chemicals. In context, model compounds have been
used to understand the electrocatalyzed depolymerization for mimicking the
typical linkages of lignin. In this investigation, 2-phenoxyacetophenone, a
model compound for lignin \b{eta}-O-4 linkage, was electro-catalytically
hydrogenated (ECH) in distinct three-electrode setups: an open and a membrane
cell. A deep eutectic solvent based on ethylene-glycol and choline chloride was
used to pursue sustainable routes to dissolve lignin. Copper was used as
electrocatalyst due to the economic feasibility and low activity towards
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a side reaction of ECH. By varying the cell
type, we demonstrate a simple ECH route for the generation of different
monomers and oligomers from lignin. Gas chromatography of the products revealed
a higher content of carbonyl groups in those using the membrane cell, whereas
the open cell produced mostly hydroxyl-end chemicals. Aiming at high
value-added products, our results disclose the cell type influence on
electrochemical reductive depolymerization of lignin. This approach encompasses

lattice structures and electrodeposition of a porous nickel catalytic layer.
Laser energy densities of ~83-333 J/m were used to fabricate ~500 um thick
electrodes made of body centered cubic unit cells of 200-500 um and strut
thicknesses of 100-200 um. Unit cells of 500 um and strut thickness of 200 um
were identified as optimum. Despite small changes in feature sizes by the
energy input, the porosity of >50% and pore size of ~100 um did not change. In
a subsequent step, we used nickel electrodeposition to create smaller scale
pores on the electrode. The electrochemical performance of the electrodes for
hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) was evaluated in a three-electrode

less negative potential of ~-0.4 V vs RHE (potential against reversible

"Performance enhancement of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution through
  coalescence-induced bubble dynamics","  The evolution of electrogenerated gas bubbles during water electrolysis can
significantly hamper the overall process efficiency. Promoting the departure of
electrochemically generated bubbles during (water) electrolysis is therefore
beneficial. For a single bubble, a departure from the electrode surface occurs
when buoyancy wins over the downward-acting forces (e.g. contact, Marangoni,
and electric forces). In this work, the dynamics of a pair of H$_2$ bubbles
produced during hydrogen evolution reaction in 0.5 M H$_2$SO$_4$ using dual
platinum micro-electrode system is systematically studied by varying the
electrode distance and the cathodic potential. By combining high-speed imaging
and electrochemical analysis, we demonstrate the importance of bubble-bubble
interactions for the departure process. We show that bubble coalescence may
lead to substantially earlier bubble departure as compared to buoyancy effects
alone, resulting in considerably higher reaction rates at constant potential.
However, due to continued mass input and conservation of momentum repeated
coalescence events with bubbles close to the electrode may drive departed
bubbles back to the surface beyond a critical current, which increases with the
electrode spacing. The latter leads to the resumption of bubble growth near the
electrode surface, followed by buoyancy-driven departure. While less favourable
at small electrode spacing, this configuration proves to be very beneficial at
larger separations increasing the mean current up to 2.4 times compared to a
single electrode under the conditions explored in this study.

hydrogen-helium plasma in the vicinity of phase coexistence boundary of this

"Self-optimizing layered hydrogen evolution catalyst with high
  basal-plane activity","  Hydrogen is a promising energy carrier and key agent for many industrial
chemical processes1. One method for generating hydrogen sustainably is via the
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which electrochemical reduction of
protons is mediated by an appropriate catalyst-traditionally, an expensive
platinum-group metal. Scalable production requires catalyst alternatives that
can lower materials or processing costs while retaining the highest possible
activity. Strategies have included dilute alloying of Pt2 or employing less
expensive transition metal alloys, compounds or heterostructures (e.g., NiMo,
metal phosphides, pyrite sulfides, encapsulated metal nanoparticles)3-5.
Recently, low-cost, layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (MX2)6 based on
molybdenum and tungsten have attracted substantial interest as alternative HER
catalysts7-11. These materials have high intrinsic per-site HER activity;
however, a significant challenge is the limited density of active sites, which
are concentrated at the layer edges.8,10,11. Here we use theory to unravel
electronic factors underlying catalytic activity on MX2 surfaces, and leverage
the understanding to report group-5 MX2 (H-TaS2 and H-NbS2) electrocatalysts
whose performance instead derives from highly active basal-plane sites. Beyond
excellent catalytic activity, they are found to exhibit an unusual ability to
optimize their morphology for enhanced charge transfer and accessibility of
active sites as the HER proceeds. This leads to long cycle life and practical
advantages for scalable processing. The resulting performance is comparable to
Pt and exceeds all reported MX2 candidates.

"Is the doped MoS2 basal plane an efficient hydrogen evolution catalyst?
  Calculations of voltage-dependent activation energy","  Transition metal dichalcogenides are cheap and earth-abundant candidates for
the replacement of precious metals as catalyst materials. Experimental
measurements of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), for example, have
demonstrated significant electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 but there is large
variation depending on preparation method. In order to gain information about
the mechanism and active sites for HER, we have carried out calculations of the
reaction and activation energy for HER at the transition metal doped basal
plane of MoS2 under electrochemical conditions, i.e. including applied
electrode potential and solvent effects. The calculations are based on
identifying the relevant saddle points on the energy surface obtained from
density functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation, and
the information on energetics is used to construct voltage-dependent volcano
plots. Doping with 3d-metal atoms as well as Pt is found to enhance hydrogen
adsorption onto the basal plane by introducing electronic states within the
band gap, and in some cases (Co, Ni, Cu, Pt) significant local symmetry
breaking. The Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism is found to be most likely and the
associated energetics show considerable dopant and voltage-dependence. While
the binding free energy of hydrogen can be tuned to be seemingly favorable for
HER, the calculated activation energy turns out to be significant, at least 0.7
eV at a voltage of -0.5 V vs. SHE, indicating low catalytic activity of the
doped basal plane. This suggests that other sites are responsible for the
experimental activity, possibly edges or basal plane defects.

"Electrolyte effects on the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction: a
  mean-field approach","  This paper introduces the combination of an advanced double-layer model with
electrochemical kinetics to explain electrolyte effects on the alkaline
hydrogen evolution reaction. It is known from experimental studies that the
alkaline hydrogen evolution current shows a strong dependence on the
concentration and identity of cations in the electrolyte, but is independent of
pH. To explain these effects, we formulate the faradaic current in terms of the
electric potential in the double layer, which is calculated using a mean-field
model that takes into account the cation and anion sizes as well as the
electric dipole moment of water molecules. We propose that the Volmer step
consists of two activated processes: a water reduction sub-step, and a sub-step
in which a hydroxide ion is transferred away from the reaction plane through
the double layer. Either of these sub-steps may limit the rate. The proposed
models for these sub-steps qualitatively explain experimental observations,
including cation effects, pH-independence, and the trend reversal between gold
and platinum electrodes. We also assess the quantitative accuracy of the
water-reduction-limited current model; we suggest that the predicted functional
relationship is valid as long as the hydrogen bonding structure of water near
the electrode is sufficiently maintained.

Analysis of Sulfur Poisoning on a PEM Fuel Cell Electrode,"  The extent of irreversible deactivation of Pt towards hydrogen oxidation
reaction (HOR) due to sulfur adsorption and subsequent electrochemical
oxidation is quantified in a functional PEM fuel cell. At 70 {\deg}C,
sequential hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exposure and electrochemical oxidation
experiments indicate that as much as 6% of total Pt sites are deactivated per
monolayer sulfur adsorption at open circuit potential of a PEM fuel cell
followed by its removal. The extent of such deactivation is much higher when
the electrode is exposed to H2S when the fuel cell is operating at a finite
load, and is dependent on the local overpotential and the duration of exposure.
Regardless of this deactivation, the H2/O2 polarization curves obtained on
post-recovery electrodes do not show performance losses suggesting that such
performance curves alone cannot be used to assess the extent of recovery due to
sulfur poisoning. A concise mechanism for the adsorption and electro-oxidation
of H2S on Pt anode is presented. H2S dissociatively adsorbs onto Pt as two
different sulfur species and at intermediate oxidation potentials, undergoes
electro-oxidation to sulfur and then to sulfur dioxide (SO2). This mechanism is
validated by charge balances between hydrogen desorption and sulfur
electro-oxidation on Pt. The ignition potential for sulfur oxidation decreases
with increase in temperature, which coupled with faster electro-oxidation
kinetics result in the easier removal of adsorbed sulfur at higher
temperatures. Furthermore, the adsorption potential is found to influence
sulfur coverage of an electrode exposed to H2S. As an implication, the local
potential of a PEM fuel cell anode exposed to H2S contaminated fuel should be
kept below the equilibrium potential for sulfur oxidation to prevent
irreversible loss of Pt sites.

  Reaction","  Development of cost-effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts
with outstanding catalytic activity, replacing cost-prohibitive noble
metal-based catalysts, is critical for practical green hydrogen production. A
popular strategy for promoting the catalytic performance of noble metal-free
catalysts is to incorporate earth-abundant transition metal (TM) atoms into
nanocarbon platforms such as carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Although data-driven
catalyst design methods can significantly accelerate the rational design of TM
element-doped CQD (M@CQD) catalysts, they suffer from either a simplified
theoretical model or the prohibitive cost and complexity of experimental data
generation. In this study, we propose an effective and facile HER catalyst
design strategy based on machine learning (ML) and ML model verification using
electrochemical methods accompanied with density functional theory (DFT)
simulations. Based on a Bayesian genetic algorithm (BGA) ML model, the Ni@CQD
catalyst on a three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (3D rGO) conductor is
proposed as the best HER catalyst under the optimal conditions of catalyst
loading, electrode type, and temperature and pH of electrolyte. We validate the
ML results with electrochemical experiments, where the Ni@CQD catalyst
exhibited superior HER activity, requiring an overpotential of 189 mV to
achieve 10 mA cm-2 with a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec-1 and impressive durability
in acidic media. We expect that this methodology and the excellent performance

"Dual-Phase MoS$_2$ And MXene Nanohybrids for Efficient Electrocatalytic
  Hydrogen Evolution","  Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS$_2$) has been recognized as a potential
substitution of Platinum (Pt) for electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER). However, the broad adoption of MoS$_2$ is hindered by its limited number
of active sites and relatively low inherent electrical conductivity. In this
work, we demonstrated a synergistic enhancement of both active site exposure
and electrical conductivity by a one-step solvothermal synthesis technique. The
1T-phase enriched MoS$_2$ was directly formed on the titanium carbide
(Ti$_3$C$_2$Tx, MXene) with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) acting as crosslinks. The
existence of edge-enriched metallic phase MoS$_2$, the conductive backbone of
MXene along with the crosslinking function of CNTs clearly improved the overall
electrical conductivity of the catalyst. Moreover, the integration of
two-dimensional (2D) MoS$_2$ with MXene effectively suppressed the MXene
oxidation and 2D layer restacking, leading to good catalytic stability. As a
result, an overpotential of 169 mV and a low Tafel slope of 51 mV/dec was
successfully achieved. This work provides a new route for 2D-based
electrocatalyst engineering and sheds light on the development of the
next-generation PGM-free HER electrocatalysts.

high-performance catalysts without containing precious metals has been a major

carriers participate in the HER process, and make the certain surface of NiSi
highly active with the Gibbs free energy nearly zero (0.07 eV), which is even
lower than Pt and locates on the top of the volcano plots. This work opens up a
new routine to develop no-precious-metal-containing HER catalysts via
topological engineering, rather than traditional defect engineering, doping
engineering, or strain engineering.

Controlled doping of electrocatalysts through engineering impurities,"  Fuel cells recombine water from H2 and O2 thereby powering e.g. cars or
houses with no direct carbon emission. In anion-exchange membrane fuel cells
(AEMFCs), to reach high power densities, operating at high pH is an alternative
to using large volumes of noble metals catalysts at the cathode, where the
oxygen-reduction reaction occurs. However, the sluggish kinetics of the
hydrogen-oxidation reaction (HOR) hinders upscaling despite promising
catalysts. Here, we observe an unexpected ingress of B into Pd nano-catalysts
synthesised by wet-chemistry, gain control over this B-doping, and report on
its influence on the HOR activity in alkaline conditions. We rationalize our
findings using ab-initio calculations of both H- and OH-adsorption on B-doped
Pd. Using this ""impurity engineering"" approach, we thus design Pt-free
catalysts as required in electrochemical energy conversion devices, e.g. next
generations of AEMFCs, that satisfy the economic and environmental constraints,
i.e. reasonable operating costs and long-term stability, to enable the hydrogen
economy.

is susceptible to various extrinsic factors, e.g. substrate, causing much
confusion and controversy. Hereby we have obtained cm-sized substrate-free
monolayer graphene suspended on electrolyte surface with gate tunability. Using
sum-frequency spectroscopy, we have observed the structural evolution versus
the gate voltage at the graphene/water interface. The Stern layer structure is
invariant within the water electrolysis window, but undergoes drastic change
when switching on the electrochemical reactions. The electrode is turned from
hydrophobic to hydrophilic near the onset of hydrogen evolution reaction due to
hydrogen adsorption. The large-size suspended pristine graphene offers a new

nanowires $\textit{in situ}$ by means of grazing-incidence transmission small-

electrodeposition and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compete and
interact during Pd electrodepositon. During the bottom-up growth of the
nanowires, we show that $\beta$-phase Pd hydride is formed. Suspending the
electrodeposition then leads to a phase transition from $\beta$- to
$\alpha$-phase Pd hydride. Additionally, we find that grain coalescence later
hinders the incorporation of hydrogen in the Pd unit cell. GTSAXS and 2D-SOR

"Excellent catalytic performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction

research topics in condensed matter physics. Quite recently, the application of
materials that feature these states has been extended to the field of
electrochemical catalysis and become an emerging research topic that is
receiving increasing interest. In particular, several recent experimental
studies performed on topological semimetals have already revealed high
catalytic performance towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), strongly
promoting acceptance of the fresh concept of the topological catalyst. This
emerging concept has experienced rapid developments in the last few years, but
these developments have been rarely summarized. Herein, we offer a

"Super-concentrated alkali hydroxide electrolytes for rechargeable Zn
  batteries","  Rechargeable Zn batteries offer safe, inexpensive energy storage, but when
deeply discharged to compete with lithium-ion batteries, they are plagued by
parasitic reactions at the Zn anodes. We apply super-concentrated alkaline
electrolytes to suppress two key parasitic reactions, hydrogen evolution and
ZnO passivation. An electrolyte with 15 M KOH displays a broad electrochemical
window (>2.5 V on Au), a high ZnO solubility (>1.5 M), and an exceptionally
high ionic conductivity (>0.27 S/cm at 25 C). Spectroscopies and ab-initio
molecular dynamics simulation suggest K+-OH- pairs and a tightened water
network to underpin the stability. The simulation further reveals unique
triggered proton hopping that offsets the lack of water wires to sustain the
conductivity. Low hydrogen evolution, confirmed via online mass spectroscopy,

"Polymer Stable Magnesium Nanocomposites Prepared by Laser Ablation for
  Efficient Hydrogen Storage","  Hydrogen is a promising alternative energy carrier that can potentially
facilitate the transition from fossil fuels to sources of clean energy because
of its prominent advantages such as high energy density (142 MJ per kg), great
variety of potential sources (for example water, biomass, organic matter), and
low environmental impact (water is the sole combustion product). However, due
to its light weight, the efficient storage of hydrogen is still an issue
investigated intensely. Various solid media have been considered in that
respect among which magnesium hydride stands out as a candidate offering
distinct advantages. Recent theoretical work indicates that MgH2 becomes less
thermodynamically stable as particle diameter decreases below 2 nm. Our DFT
(density functional theory) modeling studies have shown that the smallest
enthalpy change, corresponding to 2 unit-cell thickness (1.6 {\AA} Mg/3.0{\AA}
MgH2) of the film, is 57.7 kJ/molMg. This enthalpy change is over 10 kJ per
molMg smaller than that of the bulk. It is important to note that the range of
enthalpy change for systems that are suitable for mobile storage applications
is 15 to 24 kJ permolH at 298 K. The important key for the development of
air/stable Mg/nanocrystals is the use of PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) as an
encapsulation agent. In our work we use laser ablation, a non-electrochemical
method, for producing well dispersed nanoparticles without the presence of any
long range aggregation. The observed improved hydrogenation characteristics of
the polymer/stable Mg-nanoparticles are associated to the preparation procedure
and in any case the polymer laser ablation is a new approach for the production
of air/protected and inexpensive Mg/nanoparticles.

"Development of an eReaxFF Force Field for BZY20 Solid Oxide
  Electrocatalysis","  Electrocatalysis is a catalytic process where the rate of an electrochemical
reaction occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface can be controlled by
varying the electrical potential. Electrocatalysis can be applied to generate
hydrogen which can be stored for future use in fuel cells for clean
electricity. The use of solid oxide in electrocatalysis specially in hydrogen
evolution reaction is promising. However, further improvements are essential in
order to meet the ever-increasing global energy demand. Improvement of the
performance of these high energy chemical systems is directly linked to the
understanding and improving the complex physical and chemical phenomena and
exchanges that take place at their different interfaces. To enable large length
and time scale atomistic simulations of solid oxide electrocatalysis for
hydrogen generation, we developed an eReaxFF force field for barium zirconate
doped with 20 mol% of yttrium (BZY20). All parameters for the eReaxFF were
optimized to reproduce quantum mechanical (QM) calculations on relevant
condensed phase and cluster systems describing oxygen vacancies, vacancy
migrations, water adsorption, water splitting and hydrogen generation on the
surfaces of the BZY20 solid oxide. Using the developed force field, we
performed zero-voltage molecular dynamics simulations to observe water
adsorption and the eventual hydrogen production. Based on our simulation
results, we conclude that this force field sets a stage for the introduction of
explicit electron concept in order to simulate electron conductivity, electron
leakage and non-zero-voltage effects on hydrogen generation. Overall, we
demonstrate how atomistic-scale simulations can enhance our understanding of
processes at interfaces in solid oxide materials.

"An Electrochemical Technique for Measurements of Electrical Conductivity
  of Aqueous Electrolytes","  The technique presented here for the measurement of electrical conductivity
is based on the principle that the current converges on a small disk electrode.
Most of the ohmic resistance therefore lies within a narrow region surrounding
the disk. If the reference electrode is kept outside this zone, the potential
difference between the working and the reference electrode includes practically
all ohmic potential drops occurring in the solution. Moreover, this ohmic drop
can be related to the conductivity of the solution by an analytical expression
derived by Newman. At sufficiently high overpotentials, the rate of charge
transfer is limited by the conduction of current from the bulk solution to the
electrode. In this regime, the current varies linearly with the electrode
potential and the conductivity of the solution can be estimated from the slope
of the voltammogram using Newman's expression. The electrochemical reaction
used for measuring conductivity of solutions of salts is the cathodic reduction
of water and that used for aqueous acids is the cathodic reduction of hydrogen
ions. The technique has been used to measure conductivity of several common
aqueous electrolytes. A good agreement is found between the present technique
and the conventional technique based on AC impedance analysis.

several oxynitride semiconductors promising candidates for efficient hydrogen
and oxygen production under solar light illumination. The intense research
efforts dedicated to oxynitride materials have unveiled the majority of their
most important properties. However, two crucial aspects have received much less
attention. One is the critical issue of the compositional/structural surface
modifications occurring during operation and how these affect the

"Hybrid aqueous/ionic liquid electrolyte for high cycle stability and low
  temperature adaptability lithium-ion battery","  Aqueous rechargeable batteries are promising energy storage devices for the
high safety, environmental friendliness, and easy assembly. However, their
cycle stability and low temperature performance are limited by the narrow
electrochemical stability window and the high freezing point of the aqueous
electrolytes. Here, a hybrid electrolyte with a wide electrochemical window
(2.15V) and a low freezing point (-60 oC) is developed by using EMIMDep as a
novel additive. The hydrophobic EMIM+ accumulates on the negatively charged
electrode and repels the water molecules, thus suppressing the water splitting.
Meanwhile, the hydrophilic Dep- forms strong hydrogen bonds with water, thereby
reducing the freezing point of the electrolyte. In addition, the hybrid 1 M
LiNO3 in EMIMDep20-H2O80 electrolytes exhibit high safety and high stability
due to the non-flammability, non-volatility, and low toxicity of the EMIMDep
compared with other organic additives. Owing to the advantages of the

study the formation of Ti1-xVxH2 hydrides (0 < x < 1) and their electrochemical
properties as anodes in LiBs and NaBs half-cells. Hydrides were synthesized by
mechanochemistry of the metal powders under hydrogen atmosphere (PH2~ 8 MPa).
For V contents below 80 at.% (x < 0.8), single-phase pseudobinary dihydride
compounds Ti1-xVxH2 are formed. They crystallize in the fluorite-type structure
and are highly nanostructured (crystallite size < 10 nm). Their lattice
parameter decreases linearly with the V content leading to hydride
destabilization. Electrochemical studies were first carried out in Li-ion half
cells with full conversion between Ti1-xVxH2 hydrides and lithium. The
potential of the conversion reaction can be gradually tuned with the vanadium
content due to its destabilization effect. Furthermore, different paths for the
conversion reaction are observed for Ti-rich (x < 0.25) and V-rich (x > 0.7)

simap.ch is screened for sustainability criteria using the Common Procurement
Vocabulary (CPV) nomenclature to identify relevant ICT projects. The results
reveal to which extent such criteria as well as their determinants are
currently included in public tenders. Using two different approaches, only a
small number of tenders were found containing sustainability criteria of a wide
range from basic to comprehensive. The overall performance of Swiss public
procurement is benchmarked by comparing the identified sustainability criteria
with available criteria from international key actors in sustainable
procurement. Thus, this analysis provides novel insights on how public agencies
today take sustainability into account when procuring ICT hardware.

A User Interface Study on Sustainable City Trip Recommendations,"  The importance of promoting sustainable and environmentally responsible
practices is becoming increasingly recognized in all domains, including
tourism. The impact of tourism extends beyond its immediate stakeholders and
affects passive participants such as the environment, local businesses, and
residents. City trips, in particular, offer significant opportunities to
encourage sustainable tourism practices by directing travelers towards
destinations that minimize environmental impact while providing enriching
experiences. Tourism Recommender Systems (TRS) can play a critical role in
this. By integrating sustainability features in TRS, travelers can be guided
towards destinations that meet their preferences and align with sustainability
objectives.
  This paper investigates how different user interface design elements affect
the promotion of sustainable city trip choices. We explore the impact of
various features on user decisions, including sustainability labels for
transportation modes and their emissions, popularity indicators for
destinations, seasonality labels reflecting crowd levels for specific months,
and an overall sustainability composite score. Through a user study involving
mockups, participants evaluated the helpfulness of these features in guiding
them toward more sustainable travel options.
  Our findings indicate that sustainability labels significantly influence
users towards lower-carbon footprint options, while popularity and seasonality
indicators guide users to less crowded and more seasonally appropriate
destinations. This study emphasizes the importance of providing users with
clear and informative sustainability information, which can help them make more
sustainable travel choices. It lays the groundwork for future applications that
can recommend sustainable destinations in real-time.

"Students Perceptions of Sustainable Universities in Hungary. An
  Importance-Performance Analysis","  In order to succeed, universities are forced to respond to the new challenges
in the rapidly changing world. The recently emerging fourth-generation
universities should meet sustainability objectives to better serve their
students and their communities. It is essential for universities to measure
their sustainability performance to capitalise on their core strengths and to
overcome their weaknesses. In line with the stakeholder theory, the objective
of this study was to investigate students perceptions of university
sustainability including their expectations about and satisfaction with the
efforts that universities make towards sustainability. This paper proposes a
new approach that combines the sustainable university scale, developed by the
authors, with the importance-performance analysis to identify key areas of
university sustainability. To collect data, an online survey was conducted in
Hungary in 2019. The sustainable university scale was found to be a reliable
construct to measure different aspects of university sustainability. Results of
the importance-performance analysis suggest that students consider Hungarian
universities unsustainable. Research findings indicate that Hungarian
universities perform poorly in sustainable purchasing and renewable energy use,
but their location and their efforts towards separate waste collection are
their major competitive advantages. The main domains of university
sustainability were also discussed. This study provides university
decision-makers and researchers with insightful results supporting the
transformation of traditional universities into sustainable, fourth-generation
higher education institutions.

"Does ESG and Digital Transformation affects Corporate Sustainability?
  The Moderating role of Green Innovation","  Recently, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) has become an important
factor in companies' sustainable development. Artificial intelligence (AI) is
also a core digital technology that can create innovative, sustainable,
comprehensive, and resilient environments. ESG- and AI-based digital
transformation is a relevant strategy for managing business value and
sustainability in corporate green management operations. Therefore, this study
examines how corporate sustainability relates to ESG- and AI-based digital
transformation. Furthermore, it confirms the moderating effect of green
innovation on the process of increasing sustainability. To achieve the purpose
of this study, 359 data points collected for hypothesis testing were used for
statistical analysis and for mobile business platform users. The following
conclusions are drawn. (1) ESG activities have become key variables that enable
sustainable corporate growth. Companies can implement eco-friendly operating
processes through ESG activities. (2) This study verifies the relationship
between AI-based digital transformation and corporate sustainability and
confirms that digital transformation positively affects corporate
sustainability. In addition, societal problems can be identified and
environmental accidents prevented through technological innovation. (3) This
study does not verify the positive moderating effect of green innovation;
however, it emphasizes its necessity and importance. Although green innovation
improves performance only in the long term, it is a key factor for companies
pursuing sustainable growth. This study reveals that ESG- and AI-based digital
transformation is an important tool for promoting corporate sustainability,
broadening the literature in related fields and providing insights for
corporate management and government policymakers to advance corporate
sustainability.

"Implementing Sustainable Tourism practices in luxury resorts of
  Maldives: Sustainability principles & Tripple Bottomline Approach","  The aim of the research paper is to understand the sustainability challenges
faced by resorts mainly luxury in Maldives and to implement the sustainable
tourism practices. The Maldives economy is dependent mostly on the fishing,
boat building, boat repairing and tourism. Over recent years there is a drastic
change that has took place in Maldives in tourism industry. Maldives has
progressed to be the upper middle-income country and luxury resorts are the
reason for increased GDP in the country. Although there are some practices
associated with the luxury resorts to follow in terms of environmental
concerns. Present study focuses on the triple bottom line approach and the 12
major Sustainable Tourism Principles as a framework for sustainability
practices and its implementation including the challenges associated in
Maldives. The paper suggests some recommendations on several paradigm of
enforcing laws and regulations, waste management facilities, fostering
collaboration along with promoting local agriculture. The study also

"Literature Review of Current Sustainability Assessment Frameworks and
  Approaches for Organizations","  This systematic literature review explores sustainability assessment
frameworks (SAFs) across diverse industries. The review focuses on SAF design
approaches including the methods used for Sustainability Indicator (SI)
selection, relative importance assessment, and interdependency analysis.
Various methods, including literature reviews, stakeholder interviews,
questionnaires, Pareto analysis, SMART approach, and adherence to
sustainability standards, contribute to the complex SI selection process.
Fuzzy-AHP stands out as a robust technique for assessing relative SI
importance. While dynamic sustainability and performance indices are essential,
methods like DEMATEL, VIKOR, correlation analysis, and causal models for
interdependency assessment exhibit static limitations. The review presents
strengths and limitations of SAFs, addressing gaps in design approaches and
contributing to a comprehensive understanding. The insights of this review aim
to benefit policymakers, administrators, leaders, and researchers, fostering
sustainability practices. Future research recommendations include exploring
multi-criteria decision-making models and hybrid approaches, extending
sustainability evaluation across organizational levels and supply chains.
Emphasizing adaptability to industry specifics and dynamic global adjustments
is proposed for holistic sustainability practices, further enhancing
organizational sustainability.

"Integrating Sustainability in Controlling and Accounting Practices: A
  Critical Review and Implications for Competences in German Vocational
  Business Education","  Sustainability in accounting and controlling has traditionally been
understood in terms of securing the long-term existence of companies. However,
with the introduction of integrated non-financial reporting, sustainability, as
per the triple bottom line model, is increasingly being discussed as a
component of accounting and controlling. Yet, integration primarily occurs in
separate sustainability management and controlling departments. Moreover, the
implementation of sustainability efforts requires suitably qualified employees,
who drive the transition. The academic discourse surrounding sustainability in
businesses in general, and in accounting and controlling specifically, is
complex. It remains unclear to what extent sustainability has been integrated
into accounting and controlling, and what competencies employees need to manage
this transformation. These questions will be critically analyzed in this
structured literature review of 79 publications. The results provide insights
into a) how companies conceptualize sustainability, b) whether and how they
integrate it into their value creation processes, and c) the relevance of
accounting and controlling for these developments. To contextualize the role of
employees, the competency requirements within companies will be analyzed to
enable employees in accounting and controlling to engage effectively in
sustainability-oriented activities. Specifically, implications for changes in
curricula with a focus on accounting and controlling are derived.

"Sustainability Competencies and Skills in Software Engineering: An
  Industry Perspective","  Achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demands adequate levels
of awareness and actions to address sustainability challenges. Software systems
will play an important role in moving towards these targets. Sustainability
skills are necessary to support the development of software systems and to
provide sustainable IT-supported services for citizens. While there is a
growing number of academic bodies, including sustainability education in
engineering and computer science curricula, there is not yet comprehensive
research on the competencies and skills required by IT professionals to develop
such systems. This study aims to identify the industrial sustainability needs
for education and training from software engineers' perspective. We conducted
interviews and focus groups with experts from twenty-eight organisations with
an IT division from nine countries to understand their interests, goals and
achievements related to sustainability, and the skills and competencies needed
to achieve their goals. Our findings show that organisations are interested in
sustainability, both idealistically and increasingly for core business reasons.
They seek to improve the sustainability of processes and products but encounter
difficulties, like the trade-off between short-term financial profitability and
long-term sustainability goals. To fill the gaps, they have promoted in-house
training courses, collaborated with universities, and sent employees to
external training. The acquired competencies make sustainability an integral
part of software development. We conclude that educational programs should
include knowledge and skills on core sustainability concepts, system thinking,
soft skills, technical sustainability, sustainability impact and measurements,
values and ethics, standards and legal aspects, and advocacy and lobbying.

"Embedding Sustainability in Complex Projects: A Pedagogic Practice
  Simulation Approach","  Sustainability is focussed on avoiding the long-term depletion of natural
resources. Under the terms of a government plan to tackle climate change, a
driver for improved sustainability is the cut of greenhouse gas emissions in
the UK to almost zero by 2050. With this type of change, new themes are
continuously being developed which drive complex projects, such as the
development of new power generation methods, which encompass challenging lead
times and demanding requirements. Consideration of the implementation of
strategies and key concepts, which may engender sustainability within complex
projects therefore presents an opportunity for further critical debate, review,
and application through a project management lens. Sustainability incorporation
in project management has been documented in academic literature, with this
emerging field providing new challenges. For example, project management
education can provide a holistic base for the inculcation of sustainability
factors to a range of industries, including complex projects. Likewise,
practitioner interest and approaches to sustainability in project management
are being driven by the recently Chartered Association for Project Management
(APM). Whilst this body makes a significant contribution to the UK economy
across many sectors, it also addresses ongoing sustainability challenges.
Therefore, by drawing on research and practitioner developments, the authors
argue that by connecting with the next generation through practice simulation
approaches, and embedding sustainability issues within project management tools
and methods, improved focus on sustainability in complex project management may
be achieved.

"A Strong Sustainability Paradigm Based Analytical Hierarchy Process
  (SSP-AHP) Method to Evaluate Sustainable Healthcare Systems","  The recent studies signify the growing concern of researchers towards
monitoring and measuring sustainability performance at various levels and in
many fields, including healthcare. However, there is no agreed approach to
assessing the sustainability of health systems. Moreover, social indicators are
less developed and less succinct. Therefore, the authors seek to map
sustainable reference values in healthcare and propose a conceptual and
structured framework that can guide the measurement of the social
sustainability-oriented health systems. Based on a new multi-criteria method
called Strong Sustainability Paradigm based Analytical Hierarchy Process,
(SSP-AHP), the presented approach opens the availability for systems'
comparison and benchmarking. The Strong Sustainability Paradigm incorporated
into the multi-criteria evaluation method prevents the exchangeability of
criteria by promoting alternatives that achieve good performance values on all
criteria, implying sustainability. The research results offer insights into the
core domains, sub-domains, and indicators supporting a more comprehensive
assessment of the social sustainability of health systems. The framework
constructed in this study consists of five major areas: equity, quality,
responsiveness, financial coverage, and adaptability. The proposed set of
indicators can also serve as a reference instrument, providing transparency
about core aspects of performance to be measured and reported, as well as
supporting policy-makers in decisions regarding sectoral strategies in
healthcare. Our findings suggest that the most socially sustainable systems are
Nordic countries. They offer a high level of social and financial protection,
achieving very good health outcomes. On the other hand, the most unsustainable
systems located in central and eastern European countries.

"Energy-Sustainable IoT Connectivity: Vision, Technological Enablers,
  Challenges, and Future Directions","  Technology solutions must effectively balance economic growth, social equity,
and environmental integrity to achieve a sustainable society. Notably, although
the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm constitutes a key sustainability enabler,
critical issues such as the increasing maintenance operations, energy
consumption, and manufacturing/disposal of IoT devices have long-term negative
economic, societal, and environmental impacts and must be efficiently
addressed. This calls for self-sustainable IoT ecosystems requiring minimal
external resources and intervention, effectively utilizing renewable energy
sources, and recycling materials whenever possible, thus encompassing energy
sustainability. In this work, we focus on energy-sustainable IoT during the
operation phase, although our discussions sometimes extend to other
sustainability aspects and IoT lifecycle phases. Specifically, we provide a
fresh look at energy-sustainable IoT and identify energy provision, transfer,
and energy efficiency as the three main energy-related processes whose
harmonious coexistence pushes toward realizing self-sustainable IoT systems.
Their main related technologies, recent advances, challenges, and research
directions are also discussed. Moreover, we overview relevant performance
metrics to assess the energy-sustainability potential of a certain technique,
technology, device, or network and list some target values for the next
generation of wireless systems. Overall, this paper offers insights that are
valuable for advancing sustainability goals for present and future generations.

"Balancing Progress and Responsibility: A Synthesis of Sustainability
  Trade-Offs of AI-Based Systems","  Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities have increased
the eagerness of companies to integrate AI into software systems. While AI can
be used to have a positive impact on several dimensions of sustainability, this
is often overshadowed by its potential negative influence. While many studies
have explored sustainability factors in isolation, there is insufficient
holistic coverage of potential sustainability benefits or costs that
practitioners need to consider during decision-making for AI adoption. We
therefore aim to synthesize trade-offs related to sustainability in the context
of integrating AI into software systems. We want to make the sustainability
benefits and costs of integrating AI more transparent and accessible for
practitioners.
  The study was conducted in collaboration with a Dutch financial organization.
We first performed a rapid review that led to the inclusion of 151 research
papers. Afterward, we conducted six semi-structured interviews to enrich the
data with industry perspectives. The combined results showcase the potential
sustainability benefits and costs of integrating AI. The labels synthesized
from the review regarding potential sustainability benefits were clustered into
16 themes, with ""energy management"" being the most frequently mentioned one. 11
themes were identified in the interviews, with the top mentioned theme being
""employee wellbeing"". Regarding sustainability costs, the review discovered
seven themes, with ""deployment issues"" being the most popular one, followed by
""ethics & society"". ""Environmental issues"" was the top theme from the
interviews. Our results provide valuable insights to organizations and
practitioners for understanding the potential sustainability implications of
adopting AI.

"Multidimensional spatiotemporal clustering -- An application to
  environmental sustainability scores in Europe","  The assessment of corporate sustainability performance is extremely relevant
in facilitating the transition to a green and low-carbon intensity economy.
However, companies located in different areas may be subject to different
sustainability and environmental risks and policies. Henceforth, the main
objective of this paper is to investigate the spatial and temporal pattern of
the sustainability evaluations of European firms. We leverage on a large
dataset containing information about companies' sustainability performances,
measured by MSCI ESG ratings, and geographical coordinates of firms in Western
Europe between 2013 and 2023. By means of a modified version of the Chavent et
al. (2018) hierarchical algorithm, we conduct a spatial clustering analysis,
combining sustainability and spatial information, and a spatiotemporal
clustering analysis, which combines the time dynamics of multiple
sustainability features and spatial dissimilarities, to detect groups of firms
with homogeneous sustainability performance. We are able to build
cross-national and cross-industry clusters with remarkable differences in terms
of sustainability scores. Among other results, in the spatio-temporal analysis,
we observe a high degree of geographical overlap among clusters, indicating
that the temporal dynamics in sustainability assessment are relevant within a
multidimensional approach. Our findings help to capture the diversity of ESG
ratings across Western Europe and may assist practitioners and policymakers in
evaluating companies facing different sustainability-linked risks in different
areas.

"Thermodynamics of sustaining gases in the roughness of submerged
  superhydrophobic surfaces","  Rough surfaces submerged in a liquid can remain almost dry if the liquid does
not fully wet the roughness and gases are sustained in roughness grooves. Such
partially dry surfaces can help reduce drag or enhance boiling. Gases sustained
in roughness grooves would be composed of air and the vapor phase of the liquid
itself. The thermodynamics of sustaining vapor was considered in a prior work
[Patankar, Soft Matter, 2010, 6:1613]. Here, the thermodynamics of sustaining
gases (e.g. air) is considered. Governing equations are presented along with a
solution methodology to determine a critical condition to sustain gases. The
critical roughness scale to sustain gases is estimated for different degrees of
saturation of gases dissolved in the liquid. It is shown that roughness
spacings of less than a micron are essential to sustain gases on surfaces
submerged in water at atmospheric pressure. This is consistent with prior
empirical data.

Exploring the roles of ICT in supporting sustainability practices,"  The concern about sustainability has arisen due to the overuse of natural
resources and the increased use of energy consumption over the last decades.
Information communication technologies (ICT) has the potential to address the
three main aspects of sustainability (people, planet, profit) and therefore,
several organizations have initiated a sustainable development by integrating
ICT within their business activities. However, the roles of ICT in supporting
sustainability initiatives have only been discussed in a limited number of
studies and there is a lack of practical examples that demonstrate how the
different roles of ICT are played out in an organization's environment.
Therefore, this research aims to explore how ICT can be used by organizations
to support sustainability initiatives. In particular, in this
research-in-progress paper, we examine how a leading organization deploys
Internet-of-Things as an example of an ICT application to support various
sustainability initiatives. The study findings enhance the current
understanding of how ICT can support sustainability practices of organizations.

"Multivariate Modeling for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure
  Systems and Communities","  Sustainability and resilience of urban systems are multifaceted concepts,
requiring information about multiple system attributes to adequately evaluate
and characterize. However, despite the scientific consensus on the multivariate
nature of these concepts, many of the existing techniques to model urban
sustainability and resilience are unidimensional in nature, focusing on a
characterizing a single element of highly interconnected urban systems. We
champion a paradigm shift in modeling urban sustainability and resilience,
using an integrated approach to simultaneously estimate multiple interconnected
(correlated) system attributes of sustainability and resilience as a function
of key environmental factors. We present a novel case study and review a few
recent studies to illustrate the applicability and benefits of the multivariate
approach to modeling urban sustainability and resilience. Our proposed
framework can be utilized by infrastructure managers, urban planners, and
researchers to conceptualize and assess urban sustainability and resilience

"Analysis of Biomass Sustainability Indicators from a Machine Learning
  Perspective","  Plant biomass estimation is critical due to the variability of different
environmental factors and crop management practices associated with it. The
assessment is largely impacted by the accurate prediction of different
environmental sustainability indicators. A robust model to predict
sustainability indicators is a must for the biomass community. This study
proposes a robust model for biomass sustainability prediction by analyzing
sustainability indicators using machine learning models. The prospect of
ensemble learning was also investigated to analyze the regression problem. All
experiments were carried out on a crop residue data from the Ohio state. Ten
machine learning models, namely, linear regression, ridge regression,
multilayer perceptron, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, decision
tree, gradient boosting, random forest, stacking and voting, were analyzed to
estimate three biomass sustainability indicators, namely soil erosion factor,
soil conditioning index, and organic matter factor. The performance of the
model was assessed using cross-correlation (R2), root mean squared error and
mean absolute error metrics. The results showed that Random Forest was the best
performing model to assess sustainability indicators. The analyzed model can
now serve as a guide for assessing sustainability indicators in real time.

"Employment, labor productivity and environmental sustainability:
  Firm-level evidence from transition","  This paper examines how investment in environmentally sustainable practices
impacts employment and labor productivity growth of firms in transition
economies. The study considers labor skill composition and geographical
differences, shedding light on sustainability dynamics. The empirical analysis
relies on the World Bank-s Enterprise Survey 2019 for 24 transition economies,
constructing an environmental sustainability index from various indicators
through a Principal Components Analysis. To address endogeneity, a battery of
fixed effects and instrumental variables are employed. Results reveal the
relevance of environmental sustainability for both employment and labor
productivity growth. However, the significance diminishes when addressing
endogeneity comprehensively, alluding that any relation between environmentally
sustainable practices and jobs growth is more complex and needs time to work.
The decelerating job-creation effect of sustainability investments is however
confirmed for the high-skill firms, while low-skill firms benefit from labor
productivity gains spurred by such investment. Geographically, Central Europe
sees more pronounced labor productivity impacts, possibly due to its higher
development and sustainability-awareness levels as compared to Southeast Europe
and the Commonwealth of Independent States.

"Selection of Alternative Local Interconnect Metals: Beyond Traditional
  Criteria Towards Sustainable and Secure Supply Chains","  In response to aggressive scaling demands in semiconductor manufacturing and
the growing need to apply sustainable practices, this paper presents a holistic
sustainability assessment framework for evaluating alternative metals for
advanced applications. The framework, consisting of seven sustainability
aspects, aims to guide researchers and industry stakeholders towards decisions
fostering a more sustainable and secure future for microelectronics. This study
applies the framework to assess the sustainability of alternative local
interconnect metals. The framework identifies five metals (Ti, Al, Ni, Co, and
Mo) with relatively favourable performance in at least six out of nine specific
indicators, while others (Pt, Ru, Ir, Rh, and Pd) exhibit poorer sustainability
metrics. The study recommends further analyses, suggesting the incorporation of
case-specific functional units and the use of normalization and weighting
factors for a comprehensive evaluation. Coupled with traditional technological
assessments, this framework equips decision-makers with essential tools to
broaden criteria for selecting alternative metals, aligning semiconductor
manufacturing with broader sustainability objectives.

System Support for Environmentally Sustainable Computing in Data Centers,"  Modern data centers suffer from a growing carbon footprint due to
insufficient support for environmental sustainability. While hardware
accelerators and renewable energy have been utilized to enhance sustainability,
addressing Quality of Service (QoS) degradation caused by renewable energy
supply and hardware recycling remains challenging: (1) prior accelerators
exhibit significant carbon footprints due to limited reconfigurability and
inability to adapt to renewable energy fluctuations; (2) integrating recycled
NAND flash chips in data centers poses challenges due to their short lifetime,
increasing energy consumption; (3) the absence of a sustainability estimator
impedes data centers and users in evaluating and improving their environmental
impact. This study aims to improve system support for environmentally
sustainable data centers by proposing a reconfigurable hardware accelerator for
intensive computing primitives and developing a fractional NAND flash cell to
extend the lifetime of recycled flash chips while supporting graceful capacity
degradation. We also introduce a sustainability estimator to evaluate user task
energy consumption and promote sustainable practices. We present our
preliminary results and recognize this as an ongoing initiative with
significant potential to advance environmentally sustainable computing in data
centers and stimulate further exploration in this critical research domain.

Self-Sustaining Iterated Learning,"  An important result from psycholinguistics (Griffiths & Kalish, 2005) states
that no language can be learned iteratively by rational agents in a
self-sustaining manner. We show how to modify the learning process slightly in
order to achieve self-sustainability. Our work is in two parts. First, we
characterize iterated learnability in geometric terms and show how a slight,
steady increase in the lengths of the training sessions ensures
self-sustainability for any discrete language class. In the second part, we
tackle the nondiscrete case and investigate self-sustainability for iterated
linear regression. We discuss the implications of our findings to issues of
non-equilibrium dynamics in natural algorithms.

DinAR: Augmenting Reality for Sustainable Dining,"  Sustainable food is among the many challenges associated with climate change.
The resources required to grow or gather the food and the distance it travels
to reach the consumer are two key factors of an ingredient's sustainability.
Food that is grown locally and is currently ""in-season"" will have a lower
carbon footprint, but when dining out these details unfortunately may not
affect one's ordering preferences. We introduce DinAR as an immersive
experience to make this information more accessible and to encourage better
dining choices through friendly competition with a leaderboard of
sustainability scores. Our study measures the effectiveness of immersive AR
experiences on impacting consumer preferences towards sustainability.

Sustainable Business Models: A Review,"  The concept of the sustainable business model describes the rationale of how
an organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social,
cultural, or other contexts, in a sustainable way. The process of sustainable
business model construction forms an innovative part of a business strategy.
Different industries and businesses have utilized sustainable business models
concept to satisfy their economic, environmental, and social goals
simultaneously. However, the success, popularity, and progress of sustainable
business models in different application domains are not clear. To explore this
issue, this research provides a comprehensive review of sustainable business
models literature in various application areas. Notable sustainable business
models are identified and further classified in fourteen unique categories, and
in every category, the progress -- either failure or success -- has been

cloud-oriented sustainable learning environment for a higher education
institution. The article substantiates the expediency of designing such an
environment as a prerequisite for the sustainable development of Ukraine. It is
established that one of the goals of Ukraine's sustainable development for 2030
is to provide fair quality education and to promote lifelong learning
opportunities for all. Green IT is a set of approaches related to sustainable
computing and information technology. The work of foreign scientists was
analyzed, which considered the issues of designing the learning environment
using green computing. As a result, Cloud LMS has been established that cloud
LMS is a type of green IT and can serve as a tool for designing a
cloud-oriented sustainable learning environment of a higher education

"A Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing Analysis of Youth
  Perspectives: Key Trends and Focus Areas for Sustainable Youth Development
  Policies","  Investing in children and youth is a critical step towards inclusive,
equitable, and sustainable development for current and future generations.
Several international agendas for accomplishing common global goals emphasize
the need for active youth participation and engagement for sustainable
development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development emphasizes the need
for youth engagement and the inclusion of youth perspectives as an important
step toward addressing each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The aim of
this study is to analyze youth perspectives, values, and sentiments towards
issues addressed by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals through social network
analysis using machine learning. Social network data collected during 7 major
sustainability conferences aimed at engaging children and youth is analyzed
using natural language processing techniques for sentiment analysis. This data
categorized using a natural language processing text classifier trained on a
sample dataset of social network data during the 7 youth sustainability
conferences for deeper understanding of youth perspectives in relation to the
SDGs. Machine learning identified demographic and location attributes and
features are utilized in order to identify bias and demographic differences
between ages, gender, and race among youth. Using natural language processing,
the qualitative data collected from over 7 different countries in 3 languages
are systematically translated, categorized, and analyzed, revealing key trends
and focus areas for sustainable youth development policies. The obtained
results reveal the general youth's depth of knowledge on sustainable
development and their attitudes towards each of the 17 SDGs. The findings of
this study serve as a guide toward better understanding the interests, roles,

"Exploring the current applications and potential of extended reality for
  environmental sustainability in manufacturing","  In response to the transformation towards Industry 5.0, there is a growing
call for manufacturing systems that prioritize environmental sustainability,
alongside the emerging application of digital tools. Extended Reality (XR) -
including Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) -
is one of the technologies identified as an enabler for Industry 5.0. XR could
potentially also be a driver for more sustainable manufacturing: however, its
potential environmental benefits have received limited attention. This paper
aims to explore the current manufacturing applications and research within the
field of XR technology connected to the environmental sustainability principle.
The objectives of this paper are two-fold: (1) Identify the currently explored
use cases of XR technology in literature and research, addressing environmental
sustainability in manufacturing; (2) Provide guidance and references for
industry and companies to use cases, toolboxes, methodologies, and workflows
for implementing XR in environmental sustainable manufacturing practices. Based
on the categorization of sustainability indicators, developed by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the authors analyzed and mapped
the current literature, with criteria of pragmatic XR use cases for
manufacturing. The exploration resulted in a mapping of the current
applications and use cases of XR technology within manufacturing that has the
potential to drive environmental sustainability. The results are presented as
stated use-cases with reference to the literature, contributing as guidance and
inspiration for future researchers or implementations in industry, using XR as
a driver for environmental sustainability. Furthermore, the authors open up the
discussion for future work and research to increase the attention of XR as a
driver for environmental sustainability.

Stability and Sustainability of Resource Consumption Networks,"  In this paper, we examine both stability and sustainability of a
network-based model of natural resource consumption. Stability is studied from
a dynamical systems perspective, though we argue that sustainability is a
fundamentally different notion from stability in social-ecological systems.
Accordingly, we also present a criterion for sustainability that is guided by
the existing literature on sustainable development. Assuming a generic social
network of consuming agents' interactions, we derive sufficient conditions for
both the stability and sustainability of the model as constraints on the
network structure itself. We complement these analytical results with numerical
simulations and discuss the implications of our findings for policy-making for
sustainable resource governance.

"Critical Review on Sustainable Homogeneous Cellulose Modification: Why
  Renewability Is Not Enough","  As we passed the 20th anniversary of the publication of the 12 principles of
green chemistry, the sustainable modification of cellulose, being the most
abundant biobased polymer, is certainly worth considering. Many researchers
work on an efficient valorization of this renewable resource due to its
manifold and promising application possibilities, but very often the use of
non-sustainable approaches (i.e., solvents, reactants and modification
approaches) only addresses the renewability aspect of cellulose, while
neglecting most or all of the other principles of green chemistry. In this
review, we have employed the use of E-factors together with basic toxicity
information to compare between various approaches for homogeneous cellulose
modification. This approach, though simple and certainly not overarching, can
provide a quick and useful first sustainability assessment. Therefore, in order
to achieve a truly sustainable modification of cellulose, its renewability
combined with mild and efficient reaction protocols is crucial in order to
obtain sustainable materials that are capable of reducing the overall negative
impact of today's fossil-based polymeric materials.

How Value-Sensitive Design Can Empower Sustainable Consumption,"  In a so-called overpopulated world, sustainable consumption is of existential
importance.However, the expanding spectrum of product choices and their
production complexity challenge consumers to make informed and value-sensitive
decisions. Recent approaches based on (personalized) psychological manipulation
are often intransparent, potentially privacy-invasive and inconsistent with
(informational) self-determination. In contrast, responsible consumption based
on informed choices currently requires reasoning to an extent that tends to
overwhelm human cognitive capacity. As a result, a collective shift towards
sustainable consumption remains a grand challenge. Here we demonstrate a novel
personal shopping assistant implemented as a smart phone app that supports a
value-sensitive design and leverages sustainability awareness, using experts'
knowledge and ""wisdom of the crowd"" for transparent product information and
explainable product ratings. Real-world field experiments in two supermarkets
confirm higher sustainability awareness and a bottom-up behavioral shift
towards more sustainable consumption. These results encourage novel business
models for retailers and producers, ethically aligned with consumer preferences
and with higher sustainability.

On Sustainable Equilibria,"  Following the ideas laid out in Myerson (1996), Hofbauer (2000) defined a
Nash equilibrium of a finite game as sustainable if it can be made the unique
Nash equilibrium of a game obtained by deleting/adding a subset of the
strategies that are inferior replies to it. This paper proves two results about
sustainable equilibria. The first concerns the Hofbauer-Myerson conjecture
about the relationship between the sustainability of an equilibrium and its
index: for a generic class of games, an equilibrium is sustainable iff its
index is $+1$. Von Schemde and von Stengel (2008) proved this conjecture for
bimatrix games; we show that the conjecture is true for all finite games. More
precisely, we prove that an isolated equilibrium has index +1 if and only if it
can be made unique in a larger game obtained by adding finitely many strategies
that are inferior replies to that equilibrium. Our second result gives an
axiomatic extension of sustainability to all games and shows that only the Nash
components with positive index can be sustainable.

Sustainability in Software Architecture: A Systematic Mapping Study,"  Sustainability is an increasingly-studied topic in software engineering in
general, and in software architecture in particular. There are already a number
of secondary studies addressing sustainability in software engineering, but no
such study focusing explicitly on software architecture. This work aims to fill
this gap by conducting a systematic mapping study on the intersection between
sustainability and software architecture research with the intention of (i)
reflecting on the current state of the art, and (ii) identifying the needs for
further research. Our results show that, overall, existing works have focused
disproportionately on specific aspects of sustainability, and in particular on
the most technical and ""inward facing"" ones. This comes at the expense of the
holistic perspective required to address a multi-faceted concern such as
sustainability. Furthermore, more reflection-oriented research works, and
better coverage of the activities in the architecting life cycle are required
to further the maturity of the area. Based on our findings we then propose a
research agenda for sustainability-aware software architecture.

GreenDB: Toward a Product-by-Product Sustainability Database,"  The production, shipping, usage, and disposal of consumer goods have a
substantial impact on greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of resources.
Modern retail platforms rely heavily on Machine Learning (ML) for their search
and recommender systems. Thus, ML can potentially support efforts towards more
sustainable consumption patterns, for example, by accounting for sustainability
aspects in product search or recommendations. However, leveraging ML potential
for reaching sustainability goals requires data on sustainability.
Unfortunately, no open and publicly available database integrates
sustainability information on a product-by-product basis. In this work, we
present the GreenDB, which fills this gap. Based on search logs of millions of
users, we prioritize which products users care about most. The GreenDB schema
extends the well-known schema.org Product definition and can be readily
integrated into existing product catalogs to improve sustainability information
available for search and recommendation experiences. We present our proof of
concept implementation of a scraping system that creates the GreenDB dataset.

"Enhancing Agile Software Development Sustainability through the
  Integration of User Experience and Gamification","  This article provides a rich discussion on how the sustainability of agile
development processes can be enhanced. In particular, we focus on a recently
developed framework, named GLUX, that integrates Lean UX into Scrum. GLUX's
main goal is to facilitate a seamless integration between agile and user
experience (UX) by using gamification to motivate agile teams to adopt a
user-centered mindset and carry out UX activities collaboratively throughout
the development process. Our role as software researchers is to contribute
towards improving software sustainability and provide the software engineering
community with the tools and techniques that will improve the human, economic,
and environmental sustainability of software development. We found that GLUX
addresses human sustainability by empowering self-sufficient, problem-focused
teams, building a motivating and engaging environment, and developing team
cooperation. Economic sustainability is addressed by minimizing UX debt and
using gamification techniques to direct the focus of the behavior and mindset
of agile teams towards value creation. Finally, environmental sustainability is
promoted by encouraging agile teams to build a minimum viable product (MVP).

"Artificial Intelligence for Real Sustainability? -- What is Artificial
  Intelligence and Can it Help with the Sustainability Transformation?","  The discussion about the disruptive possibilities of a technology called
artificial intelligence (AI) is on everyone's lips. Companies and countries
alike are running multi-billion-dollar research programmes to ensure they do
not miss out on the global innovation hunt. Among many other applications, AI
is also supposed to aid the large-scale changes needed to achieve sustainable
societies. To assess those claims and possibilities, this article briefly
explains, classifies, and theorises AI technology and then politically
contextualises that analysis in light of the sustainability discourse. Based on
those insights it finally argues, that AI can play a small role in moving
towards sustainable societies, however the fixation on technological
innovation, especially AI, obscures and depoliticises the necessary societal
decisions regarding sustainability goals and means as mere technicalities and
therefore rather obstructs real and effective societal transformation efforts.

"Sustainable business decision modelling with blockchain and digital
  twins: A survey","  Industry 4.0 and beyond will rely heavily on sustainable Business Decision
Modelling (BDM) that can be accelerated by blockchain and Digital Twin (DT)
solutions. BDM is built on models and frameworks refined by key identification
factors, data analysis, and mathematical or computational aspects applicable to
complex business scenarios. Gaining actionable intelligence from collected data
for BDM requires a carefully considered infrastructure to ensure data
transparency, security, accessibility and sustainability. Organisations should
consider social, economic and environmental factors (based on the triple bottom
line approach) to ensure sustainability when integrating such an
infrastructure. These sustainability features directly impact BDM concerning
resource optimisation, stakeholder engagement, regulatory compliance and
environmental impacts. To further understand these segments, taxonomies are
defined to evaluate blockchain and DT sustainability features based on an
in-depth review of the current state-of-the-art research. Detailed comparative
evaluations provide insight into the reachability of the sustainable solution
in terms of ideologies, access control and performance overheads. Several
research questions are put forward to motivate further research that
significantly impacts BDM. Finally, a case study based on an exemplary supply
chain management system is presented to show the interoperability of blockchain

"Individual and Social Requirement Aspects of Sustainable eLearning
  Systems","  Internationalization of the higher education has created the so-called
borderless university, which provides better opportunities for learning and
increases the human and social sustainability. eLearning systems are a special
kind of software systems, developed to provide a platform for accessible
teaching and learning, including also online access to learning materials and
online support for learning and teaching. The aim of our current work is to
extract, analyse, and combine the results from multiple studies in order to
develop an RE framework for sustainable eLearning systems.
  We call a system sustainable, if it has a positive effect on and whose direct
and indirect negative impacts resulting from its development, deployment, and
usage are minimal. Sustainability has various dimensions. We classify
sustainability requirements of eLearning system to five dimensions: individual
(human), social, technical, environmental, and economic. In this paper, we
focus on human and social aspects (i.e., individual needs the relationship of
people within society), as the eLearning systems have a very strong impact on
human dimension of sustainability, where their impact on environmental
dimension is rather small. This also provides us a basis to identify the
corresponding requirements for sustainable eLearning systems. These
requirements include collaboration, learner-centred features, leadership
development and the reuse of the learning materials. As a result, achieving
individual and social requirements for eLearning systems would provide higher

"On the Presence of Green and Sustainable Software Engineering in Higher
  Education Curricula","  Nowadays, software is pervasive in our everyday lives. Its sustainability and
environmental impact have become major factors to be considered in the
development of software systems. Millennials-the newer generation of university
students-are particularly keen to learn about and contribute to a more
sustainable and green society. The need for training on green and sustainable
topics in software engineering has been reflected in a number of recent
studies. The goal of this paper is to get a first understanding of what is the
current state of teaching sustainability in the software engineering community,
what are the motivations behind the current state of teaching, and what can be
done to improve it. To this end, we report the findings from a targeted survey
of 33 academics on the presence of green and sustainable software engineering
in higher education. The major findings from the collected data suggest that
sustainability is under-represented in the curricula, while the current focus
of teaching is on energy efficiency delivered through a fact-based approach.
The reasons vary from lack of awareness, teaching material and suitable
technologies, to the high effort required to teach sustainability. Finally, we
provide recommendations for educators willing to teach sustainability in
software engineering that can help to suit millennial students needs.

"A Taxonomy and Future Directions for Sustainable Cloud Computing: 360
  Degree View","  The cloud computing paradigm offers on-demand services over the Internet and
supports a wide variety of applications. With the recent growth of Internet of
Things (IoT) based applications the usage of cloud services is increasing
exponentially. The next generation of cloud computing must be energy-efficient
and sustainable to fulfil the end-user requirements which are changing
dynamically. Presently, cloud providers are facing challenges to ensure the
energy efficiency and sustainability of their services. The usage of large
number of cloud datacenters increases cost as well as carbon footprints, which
further effects the sustainability of cloud services. In this paper, we propose
a comprehensive taxonomy of sustainable cloud computing. The taxonomy is used
to investigate the existing techniques for sustainability that need careful
attention and investigation as proposed by several academic and industry
groups. Further, the current research on sustainable cloud computing is
organized into several categories: application design, sustainability metrics,
capacity planning, energy management, virtualization, thermal-aware scheduling,
cooling management, renewable energy and waste heat utilization. The existing
techniques have been compared and categorized based on the common
characteristics and properties. A conceptual model for sustainable cloud
computing has been proposed along with discussion on future research
directions.

"Software Sustainability: A Systematic Literature Review and
  Comprehensive Analysis","  Software Engineering is a constantly evolving subject area that faces new
challenges every day as it tries to automate newer business processes. One of
the key challenges to the success of a software solution is attaining
sustainability. The inability of numerous software to sustain for the desired
time-length is caused by limited consideration given towards sustainability
during the stages of software development. This review aims to present a
detailed and inclusive study covering both the technical and non-technical
challenges and approaches of software sustainability. A systematic and
comprehensive literature review was conducted based on 107 relevant studies
that were selected using the Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE)
technique. The study showed that sustainability can be achieved by conducting
specific activities at the technical and non-technical levels. The technical
level consists of software design, coding, and user experience attributes. The
non-technical level consists of documentation, sustainability manifestos,
training of software engineers, funding software projects, and leadership
skills of project managers to achieve sustainability. This paper groups the
existing research efforts based on the above aspects. Next, how those aspects
affect open and closed source software is tabulated. Based on the findings of
this review, it is seen that both technical and non-technical sustainability
aspects are equally important, taking one into contention and ignoring the
other will threaten the sustenance of software products.

"Multi-Objective Optimization for Value-Sensitive and Sustainable Basket
  Recommendations","  Sustainable consumption aims to minimize the environmental and societal
impact of the use of services and products. Over-consumption of services and
products leads to potential natural resource exhaustion and societal
inequalities as access to goods and services becomes more challenging. In
everyday life, a person can simply achieve more sustainable purchases by
drastically changing their lifestyle choices and potentially going against
their personal values or wishes. Conversely, achieving sustainable consumption
while accounting for personal values is a more complex task as potential
trade-offs arise when trying to satisfy environmental and personal goals. This
article focuses on value-sensitive design of recommender systems, which enable
consumers to improve the sustainability of their purchases while respecting
personal and societal values. Value-sensitive recommendations for sustainable
consumption are formalized as a multi-objective optimization problem, where
each objective represents different sustainability goals and personal values.
Novel and existing multi-objective algorithms calculate solutions to this
problem. The solutions are proposed as personalized sustainable basket
recommendations to consumers. These recommendations are evaluated on a
synthetic dataset, which comprises three established real-world datasets from
relevant scientific and organizational reports. The synthetic dataset contains
quantitative data on product prices, nutritional values, and environmental
impact metrics, such as greenhouse gas emissions and water footprint. The
recommended baskets are highly similar to consumer purchased baskets and
aligned with both sustainability goals and personal values relevant to health,
expenditure, and taste. Even when consumers would accept only a fraction of
recommendations, a considerable reduction of environmental impact is observed.

"Can Machine Learning Tools Support the Identification of Sustainable
  Design Leads From Product Reviews? Opportunities and Challenges","  The increasing number of product reviews posted online is a gold mine for
designers to know better about the products they develop, by capturing the
voice of customers, and to improve these products accordingly. In the meantime,
product design and development have an essential role in creating a more
sustainable future. With the recent advance of artificial intelligence
techniques in the field of natural language processing, this research aims to
develop an integrated machine learning solution to obtain sustainable design
insights from online product reviews automatically. In this paper, the
opportunities and challenges offered by existing frameworks - including Python
libraries, packages, as well as state-of-the-art algorithms like BERT - are
discussed, illustrated, and positioned along an ad hoc machine learning
process. This contribution discusses the opportunities to reach and the
challenges to address for building a machine learning pipeline, in order to get
insights from product reviews to design more sustainable products, including
the five following stages, from the identification of sustainability-related
reviews to the interpretation of sustainable design leads: data collection,
data formatting, model training, model evaluation, and model deployment.
Examples of sustainable design insights that can be produced out of product
review mining and processing are given. Finally, promising lines for future
research in the field are provided, including case studies putting in parallel
standard products with their sustainable alternatives, to compare the features
valued by customers and to generate in fine relevant sustainable design leads.

"GreenDB -- A Dataset and Benchmark for Extraction of Sustainability
  Information of Consumer Goods","  The production, shipping, usage, and disposal of consumer goods have a
substantial impact on greenhouse gas emissions and the depletion of resources.
Machine Learning (ML) can help to foster sustainable consumption patterns by
accounting for sustainability aspects in product search or recommendations of
modern retail platforms. However, the lack of large high quality publicly
available product data with trustworthy sustainability information impedes the
development of ML technology that can help to reach our sustainability goals.
Here we present GreenDB, a database that collects products from European online
shops on a weekly basis. As proxy for the products' sustainability, it relies
on sustainability labels, which are evaluated by experts. The GreenDB schema
extends the well-known schema.org Product definition and can be readily
integrated into existing product catalogs. We present initial results
demonstrating that ML models trained with our data can reliably (F1 score 96%)
predict the sustainability label of products. These contributions can help to
complement existing e-commerce experiences and ultimately encourage users to
more sustainable consumption patterns.

"Exploring Sustainable Clothing Consumption in Middle-Income Countries: A
  case study of Romanian consumers","  The overconsumption of consumers under today's increasingly scarce natural
resources has overwhelmed the textile industry in middle-income countries, such
as Romania. It is becoming more and more essential to encourage sustainable
clothing consumption behaviors, such as purchasing recyclable clothes.
Notwithstanding there is a limited number of studies trying to understand the
intrinsic factors that motivate consumers' purchase intention toward
sustainable clothes in middle-income countries. Moreover, the effect of
consumers' environmental knowledge on determining their purchase intention of
sustainable clothes remains understudied. Consequently, the purpose of this
paper is to make a significant contribution to the sustainable consumption
literature by providing a consolidated framework that explores the behavioral
factors inclining Romanian consumers' purchase intention towards sustainable
clothes. The foundation of this study combines consumers' social value
orientation and the theory of planned behavior. the partial least square path
modelling procedure was used to analyze the data of 1,018 Romanian respondents.
The findings of this study show that altruistic value orientation, subjective
norms, and sustainable attitudes have a positive effect on Romanian consumers'
purchase intention of sustainable clothing. Thus, these insights provide
essential practical implications of advocating for the consumption of
sustainable clothes along with useful guidelines for practitioners in the
textile industry among middle-income countries, especially in Romania, to
reduce overconsumption.

Community Enforcement with Endogenous Records,"  I study repeated games with anonymous random matching where players
endogenously decide whether to disclose signals about their past actions. I
establish an-anti folk theorem, that when players are sufficiently long-lived,

cooperate. When players' expected lifespans are intermediate, they can sustain
some cooperation if their actions are substitutes but cannot sustain any
cooperation if their actions are complements. Therefore, the maximal level of

"A Road Less Travelled and Beyond: Towards a Roadmap for Integrating
  Sustainability into Computing Education","  Education for sustainable development has evolved to include more
constructive approaches and a better understanding of what is needed to align
education with the cultural, societal, and pedagogical changes required to
avoid the risks posed by an unsustainable society. This evolution aims to lead
us toward viable, equitable, and sustainable futures. However, computing
education, including software engineering, is not fully aligned with the
current understanding of what is needed for transformational learning in light
of our current challenges. This is partly because computing is primarily seen
as a technical field, focused on industry needs. Until recently, sustainability
was not a high priority for most businesses, including the digital sector, nor
was it a prominent focus for higher education institutions and society.
  Given these challenges, we aim to propose a research roadmap to integrate
sustainability principles and essential skills into the crowded computing
curriculum, nurturing future software engineering professionals with a
sustainability mindset. We conducted two extensive studies: a systematic review
of academic literature on sustainability in computing education and a survey of
industry professionals on their interest in sustainability and desired skills
for graduates. Using insights from these studies, we identified key topics for
teaching sustainability, including core sustainability principles, values and
ethics, systems thinking, impact measurement, soft skills, business value,
legal standards, and advocacy. Based on these findings, we will develop
recommendations for future computing education programs that emphasise
sustainability.
  The paper is accepted at the 2030 Software Engineering workshop, which is
co-located with the FSE'24 conference.

"Development Towards Sustainability: How to judge past and proposed
  policies?","  The scientific data about the state of our planet, presented at the 2012
(Rio+20) summit, documented that today's human family lives even less
sustainably than it did in 1992. The data indicate furthermore that the
environmental impacts from our current economic activities are so large, that
we are approaching situations where potentially controllable regional problems
can easily lead to uncontrollable global disasters.
  Assuming that (1) the majority of the human family, once adequately informed,
wants to achieve a ""sustainable way of life"" and (2) that the ""development
towards sustainability"" roadmap will be based on scientific principles, one
must begin with unambiguous and quantifiable definitions of these goals. As
will be demonstrated, the well known scientific method to define abstract and
complex issues by their negation, satisfies these requirements. Following this
new approach, it also becomes possible to decide if proposed and actual
policies changes will make our way of life less unsustainable, and thus move us
potentially into the direction of sustainability. Furthermore, if potentially
dangerous tipping points are to be avoided, the transition roadmap must include
some minimal speed requirements. Combining the negation method and the time
evolution of that remaining natural capital in different domains, the
transition speed for a ""development towards sustainability"" can be quantified
at local, regional and global scales.
  The presented ideas allow us to measure the rate of natural capital depletion
and the rate of restoration that will be required if humanity is to avoid
reaching a sustainable future by a collapse transition.

Sustainability Forecasting for Apache Incubator Projects,"  Although OSS development is very popular, ultimately more than 80 percent of
OSS projects fail. Identifying the factors associated with OSS success can help
in devising interventions when a project takes a downturn. OSS success has been
studied from a variety of angles, more recently in empirical studies of large
numbers of diverse projects, using proxies for sustainability, e.g., internal
metrics related to productivity and external ones, related to community
popularity. The internal socio-technical structure of projects has also been
shown important, especially their dynamics. This points to another angle on
evaluating software success, from the perspective of self-sustaining and
self-governing communities.
  To uncover the dynamics of how a project at a nascent development stage
gradually evolves into a sustainable one, here we apply a socio-technical
network modeling perspective to a dataset of Apache Software Foundation
Incubator (ASFI), sustainability-labeled projects. To identify and validate the
determinants of sustainability, we undertake a mix of quantitative and
qualitative studies of ASFI projects' socio-technical network trajectories. We
develop interpretable models which can forecast a project becoming sustainable
with more than 93 percent accuracy, within 8 months of incubation start. Based
on the interpretable models we describe a strategy for real-time monitoring and
suggesting actions, which can be used by projects to correct their
sustainability trajectories.

bring vast benefits for consumers and businesses, with considerable benefits
promised in productivity growth and innovation. To date it has reported
significant accomplishments in many areas that have been deemed as challenging
for machines, ranging from computer vision, natural language processing, audio
analysis to smart sensing and many others. The technical trend in realizing the
successes has been towards increasing complex and large size AI models so as to
solve more complex problems at superior performance and robustness. This rapid
progress, however, has taken place at the expense of substantial environmental
costs and resources. Besides, debates on the societal impacts of AI, such as
fairness, safety and privacy, have continued to grow in intensity. These issues
have presented major concerns pertaining to the sustainable development of AI.
In this work, we review major trends in machine learning approaches that can
address the sustainability problem of AI. Specifically, we examine emerging AI
methodologies and algorithms for addressing the sustainability issue of AI in
two major aspects, i.e., environmental sustainability and social sustainability
of AI. We will also highlight the major limitations of existing studies and
propose potential research challenges and directions for the development of
next generation of sustainable AI techniques. We believe that this technical

"Sustainability is Stratified: Toward a Better Theory of Sustainable
  Software Engineering","  Background: Sustainable software engineering (SSE) means creating software in
a way that meets present needs without undermining our collective capacity to
meet our future needs. It is typically conceptualized as several intersecting
dimensions or ``pillars'' -- environmental, social, economic, technical and
individual. However; these pillars are theoretically underdeveloped and require
refinement. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to generate a better
theory of SSE. Method: First, a scoping review was conducted to understand the
state of research on SSE and identify existing models thereof. Next, a
meta-synthesis of qualitative research on SSE was conducted to critique and
improve the existing models identified. Results: 961 potentially relevant
articles were extracted from five article databases. These articles were
de-duplicated and then screened independently by two screeners, leaving 243
articles to examine. Of these, 109 were non-empirical, the most common
empirical method was systematic review, and no randomized controlled
experiments were found. Most papers focus on ecological sustainability (158)
and the sustainability of software products (148) rather than processes. A
meta-synthesis of 36 qualitative studies produced several key propositions,
most notably, that sustainability is stratified (has different meanings at
different levels of abstraction) and multisystemic (emerges from interactions
among multiple social, technical, and sociotechnical systems). Conclusion: The
academic literature on SSE is surprisingly non-empirical. More empirical
evaluations of specific sustainability interventions are needed. The
sustainability of software development products and processes should be
conceptualized as multisystemic and stratified, and assessed accordingly.

"Towards Sustainable Ultrawide Bandgap Van der Waals Materials: An ab

in the face of climate change and the looming energy crisis. Tremendous efforts
have been made in the discovery and design of nanomaterials that achieve
device-level sustainability, where high performance and low operational energy
cost are prioritized. However, many of such materials are composed of elements
that are under threat of depletion and pose elevated risks to the environment.
The role of material-level sustainability in computational screening efforts
remains an open question thus far. Here we develop a general van der Waals
materials screening framework imbued with sustainability-motivated search
criteria. Using ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) materials as a backdrop -- an emerging
materials class with great prospects in dielectric, power electronics, and
ultraviolet device applications, we demonstrate how this screening framework
results in 25 sustainable UWBG layered materials comprising only of low-risks
elements. Our findings constitute a critical first-step towards reinventing a
more sustainable electronics landscape beyond silicon, with the framework
established in this work serving as a harbinger of sustainable 2D materials
discovery.

Towards a 6G embedding sustainability,"  From its conception, 6G is being designed with a particular focus on
sustainability. The general philosophy of the H2020 Hexa-X project work on
sustainability in 6G is based on two principles: to reduce direct negative life
cycle impacts of 6G systems as much as possible (Sustainable 6G) and to analyze
use cases that maximize positive environmental, social, and economic effects in
other sectors of society (6G for Sustainability or its enablement effect). To
apply this philosophy, Hexa-X is designing 6G with three sustainability
objectives in mind: to enable the reduction of emissions in 6G-powered sectors
of society, to reduce the total cost of ownership and to improve energy
efficiency. This paper describes these objectives, their associated KPIs and
quantitative targets, and the levers to reach them. Furthermore, to maximize
the positive effects of 6G through the enablement effect, a link between 6G and
the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) framework is
proposed and illustrated by Hexa-X use case families.

"Free Open Source Communities Sustainability: Does It Make a Difference
  in Software Quality?","  Context: Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities' ability to stay
viable and productive over time is pivotal for society as they maintain the
building blocks that digital infrastructure, products, and services depend on.
Sustainability may, however, be characterized from multiple aspects, and less
is known how these aspects interplay and impact community outputs, and software
quality specifically.
  Objective: This study, therefore, aims to empirically explore how the
different aspects of FOSS sustainability impact software quality.
  Method: 16 sustainability metrics across four categories were sampled and
applied to a set of 217 OSS projects sourced from the Apache Software
Foundation Incubator program. The impact of a decline in the sustainability
metrics was analyzed against eight software quality metrics using Bayesian data
analysis, which incorporates probability distributions to represent the
regression coefficients and intercepts.
  Results: Findings suggest that selected sustainability metrics do not
significantly affect defect density or code coverage. However, a positive
impact of community age was observed on specific code quality metrics, such as
risk complexity, number of very large files, and code duplication percentage.
Interestingly, findings show that even when communities are experiencing
sustainability, certain code quality metrics are negatively impacted.
  Conclusion: Findings imply that code quality practices are not consistently
linked to sustainability, and defect management and prevention may be
prioritized over the former. Results suggest that growth, resulting in a more
complex and large codebase, combined with a probable lack of understanding of
code quality standards, may explain the degradation in certain aspects of code
quality.

which is responsible to find new traversable wormholes configurations which are
sustained by their own gravitational quantum fluctuations. The same
self-sustained equation is also used to discover if topology change is
possible. In this contribution, we will show that in both uses, the
self-sustained equation will produce a Wheeler wormhole, namely a wormhole of
Planckian size. This means that, from the point of view of traversability, the
wormhole will be traversable in principle, but not in practice. From the
topology change point of view, the background metric will be fixed to be
Minkowskian in the equation governing the quantum fluctuations, which behaves
essentially as a backreaction equation, and the quantum fluctuations are let to
evolve. Analyzing this procedure, we will show that the self-sustained
equation, endowed with a Gravity's Rainbow distortion, will be responsible of a
topology change with the appearance of a Planckian wormhole.

Memory-induced mechanism for self-sustaining activity in networks,"  We study a mechanism of activity sustaining on networks inspired by a
well-known model of neuronal dynamics. Our primary focus is the emergence of
self-sustaining collective activity patterns, where no single node can stay
active by itself, but the activity provided initially is sustained within the
collective of interacting agents. In contrast to existing models of
self-sustaining activity that are caused by (long) loops present in the
network, here we focus on tree--like structures and examine activation
mechanisms that are due to temporal memory of the nodes. This approach is
motivated by applications in social media, where long network loops are rare or
absent. Our results suggest that under a weak behavioral noise, the nodes
robustly split into several clusters, with partial synchronization of nodes
within each cluster. We also study the randomly-weighted version of the models
where the nodes are allowed to change their connection strength (this can model
attention redistribution), and show that it does facilitate the self-sustained
activity.

"Toward Architectural Knowledge Sustainability. New Opportunities to
  Extend the Longevity of Systems","  Complex software systems must be maintained for years or decades, and the
effort and cost to maintain them are often high, involving continuous
refactoring to ensure their longevity in the face of changing requirements. In
this article, we introduce the notion of architectural knowledge (AK)
sustainability as a new concept to support architects dealing with the
evolution of long-lived systems. Architecture sustainability refers to the
ability of the architecture to endure over time with the minimum number of
refactoring cycles possible. We suggest that sustainability of the AK is a
function of how stable the decisions are, and we discuss a set of
sustainability criteria and metrics useful to estimate the sustainability of
this AK.

"Sustainability of environment-assisted energy transfer in quantum
  photobiological complexes","  It is shown that quantum sustainability is a universal phenomenon which
emerges during environment-assisted electronic excitation energy transfer (EET)
in photobiological complexes (PBCs), such as photosynthetic reaction centers
and centers of melanogenesis. We demonstrate that quantum photobiological
systems must be sustainable for them to simultaneously endure continuous energy
transfer and keep their internal structure from destruction or critical
instability. These quantum effects occur due to the interaction of PBCs with
their environment which can be described by means of the reduced density
operator and effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NH). Sustainable NH models of
EET predict the coherence beats, followed by the decrease of coherence down to
a small, yet non-zero value. This indicates that in sustainable PBCs, quantum
effects survive on a much larger time scale than the energy relaxation of an
exciton. We show that sustainable evolution significantly lowers the entropy of
PBCs and improves the speed and capacity of EET.

"Automated Sustainability Compliance Checking Using Process Mining and
  Formal Logic","  Business processes need to have certain constraints such that they can lead
to sustainable outcomes. These constraints can be manifold and their adherence
has to be monitored. In the past compliance checking has been applied in
several business domains without considering certain sustainability aspects,
such as multi-dimensionality and impact level. With my research I want to
contribute to the application of compliance checking techniques for the purpose
of sustainability compliance. In order to achieve this, I want to analyse and
develop data-driven approaches, which allow to automate the task of compliance
checking. The way in which this can be achieved, is be combining methods from
process mining with formal languages that can express sustainability rules in a
machine-readable manner. The main goal is to develop a compliance engine that
can be adapted by ERP systems in order to evaluate sustainability conformance
in business processes.

IoT Applications in Urban Sustainability,"  Internet of Things is one of the driving technologies behind the concept of
Smart Cities and is capable of playing a significant role in facilitating urban
sustainable development. This chapter explores the relationship between three
core concepts namely Smart Cities, Internet of Things and Sustainability;
thereby identifying the challenges and opportunities that exist in the
synergistic use of Internet of Things for sustainability, in the Smart Cities
context. Moreover, this chapter also presents some of the existing use cases
that apply Internet of Things for urban sustainable development, also
presenting the vision for these applications as they continue to evolve in and
adapt to the real world scenario. It is because of the interdisciplinary nature
of these applications that a clear comprehension of the associated challenges
becomes quintessential. Study of challenges and opportunities in this area
shall facilitate collaboration between different sectors of urban planning and
optimize the utilization of Internet of Things for sustainability.

PDE Models and Riemann-Stieltjes Integrals in Sustainability,"  Understanding sustainability through modeling involves one of the complex and
interdisciplinary activities where mathematics plays a key role. We provide
arguments favoring the need for developing global models for measuring the
status of sustainability. A global model (applicable in broader perspective)
and global sustainability indices are proposed which can be used with
real-world data. The solutions of the proposed Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs) are blended with the weight functions of Riemann Stieltjes integrals to
capture the differential importance of sustainability associated factors. The
ideas, methods, and models are new and are prepared for handling
multi-dimensional and multi-variate data. A practically adaptable formula for
measuring the sustainability index is developed with few key variables. We
provide a real-world example arising in civil engineering applications with a
numerical example to demonstrate our models.

"Mandatory Disclosure of Standardized Sustainability Metrics: The Case of
  the EU Taxonomy Regulation","  Sustainability reporting enables investors to make informed decisions and is
hoped to facilitate the transition to a green economy. The European Union's
taxonomy regulation enacts rules to discern sustainable activities and
determine the resulting green revenue, whose disclosure is mandatory for many
companies. In an experiment, we explore how this standardized metric is
received by investors relative to a sustainability rating. We find that green
revenue affects the investment probability more than the rating if the two
metrics disagree. If they agree, a strong rating has an incremental effect on
the investment probability. The effects are robust to variation in investors'
attitudes. Our findings imply that a mandatory standardized sustainability
metric is an effective means of channeling investment, which complements rather
than substitutes sustainability ratings.

"Beyond Learning from Next Item: Sequential Recommendation via
  Personalized Interest Sustainability","  Sequential recommender systems have shown effective suggestions by capturing
users' interest drift. There have been two groups of existing sequential
models: user- and item-centric models. The user-centric models capture
personalized interest drift based on each user's sequential consumption
history, but do not explicitly consider whether users' interest in items
sustains beyond the training time, i.e., interest sustainability. On the other
hand, the item-centric models consider whether users' general interest sustains
after the training time, but it is not personalized. In this work, we propose a
recommender system taking advantages of the models in both categories. Our
proposed model captures personalized interest sustainability, indicating
whether each user's interest in items will sustain beyond the training time or
not. We first formulate a task that requires to predict which items each user
will consume in the recent period of the training time based on users'
consumption history. We then propose simple yet effective schemes to augment
users' sparse consumption history. Extensive experiments show that the proposed
model outperforms 10 baseline models on 11 real-world datasets. The codes are
available at https://github.com/dmhyun/PERIS.

"Building a National Smart Campus to support sustainable business
  development: An ecosystem approach","  Universities are racing towards making their campuses and cities smart in
response to the global digitalization trend. However, the sustainability impact
of Smart Campus research, development, and innovation services on other
relevant stakeholders such as the small and medium-sized businesses, remain
under-investigated. The Finnish National Smart Campus project seeks to bridge
this gap by orchestrating a SC ecosystem where eight SC collaborate to bring
trailblazing services to businesses and society. To maximize the sustainability
impact of the SC ecosystem, this study used a participatory workshop to
identify the challenges of SC, provide a step-by-step guide on how to identify
other relevant stakeholders, and ascertain the perceived sustainability impact
using one of the SC ecosystems RDIs as a case study. The preliminary results
revealed that barriers to university-industry ecosystem development include
(i), the lack of clarity in the shared goals (i.e., value proposition) between
actors and (ii), weak stakeholder involvement in university RDI processes.
Finally, this paper proposed a SC ecosystem model which offers a mindset shift
for higher educational institutions in promoting the convergence of SC services
and sustainability to support the sustainable development of Finnish-based
SMEs.

AI Governance and Ethics Framework for Sustainable AI and Sustainability,"  AI is transforming the existing technology landscape at a rapid phase
enabling data-informed decision making and autonomous decision making. Unlike
any other technology, because of the decision-making ability of AI, ethics and
governance became a key concern. There are many emerging AI risks for humanity,
such as autonomous weapons, automation-spurred job loss, socio-economic
inequality, bias caused by data and algorithms, privacy violations and
deepfakes. Social diversity, equity and inclusion are considered key success
factors of AI to mitigate risks, create values and drive social justice.
Sustainability became a broad and complex topic entangled with AI. Many
organizations (government, corporate, not-for-profits, charities and NGOs) have
diversified strategies driving AI for business optimization and
social-and-environmental justice. Partnerships and collaborations become
important more than ever for equity and inclusion of diversified and
distributed people, data and capabilities. Therefore, in our journey towards an
AI-enabled sustainable future, we need to address AI ethics and governance as a
priority. These AI ethics and governance should be underpinned by human ethics.

Personalizing Sustainable Agriculture with Causal Machine Learning,"  To fight climate change and accommodate the increasing population, global
crop production has to be strengthened. To achieve the ""sustainable
intensification"" of agriculture, transforming it from carbon emitter to carbon
sink is a priority, and understanding the environmental impact of agricultural
management practices is a fundamental prerequisite to that. At the same time,
the global agricultural landscape is deeply heterogeneous, with differences in
climate, soil, and land use inducing variations in how agricultural systems
respond to farmer actions. The ""personalization"" of sustainable agriculture
with the provision of locally adapted management advice is thus a necessary
condition for the efficient uplift of green metrics, and an integral
development in imminent policies. Here, we formulate personalized sustainable
agriculture as a Conditional Average Treatment Effect estimation task and use
Causal Machine Learning for tackling it. Leveraging climate data, land use
information and employing Double Machine Learning, we estimate the
heterogeneous effect of sustainable practices on the field-level Soil Organic
Carbon content in Lithuania. We thus provide a data-driven perspective for
targeting sustainable practices and effectively expanding the global carbon
sink.

"Self-Reflection as a Tool to Foster Profound Sustainable Consumption
  Decisions","  The production of goods we buy on a daily basis accounts for a large portion
of greenhouse gas emissions. Although consumers have the power to influence
industries' behavior through their demand, making sustainable purchases is
challenging. Current ICT systems supporting sustainable shopping decisions are
not established in consumers' daily lifes. Shopping decisions are made on a
complex set of criteria, thus classical persuasive approaches, like
recommender-systems, might not be suitable. This work compiles the state of
research on ICT supporting sustainable consumption, outlines unsolved
challenges, and finally presents a novel concept: a system based on
self-reflection instead of classical persuasive approaches, like
recommender-systems. Self-reflection provokes revising individual behaviour and
decisions, instead of presenting instructions. Combined with additional
information on e.g., decision impact, people could learn how to make more
sustainable decisions independently. We envision the deployment of such a
system, fostering a change towards more sustainable industries to combat
climate change.

"Economic complexity and the sustainability transition: A review of data,
  methods, and literature","  Economic Complexity (EC) methods have gained increasing popularity across
fields and disciplines. In particular, the EC toolbox has proved particularly
promising in the study of complex and interrelated phenomena, such as the
transition towards a greener economy. Using the EC approach, scholars have been
investigating the relationship between EC and sustainability, proposing to
identify the distinguishing characteristics of green products and to assess the
readiness of productive and technological structures for the sustainability
transition. This article proposes to review and summarize the data, methods,
and empirical literature that are relevant to the study of the sustainability
transition from an EC perspective. We review three distinct but connected
blocks of literature on EC and environmental sustainability. First, we survey
the evidence linking measures of EC to indicators related to environmental
sustainability. Second, we review articles that strive to assess the green
competitiveness of productive systems. Third, we examine evidence on green
technological development and its connection to non-green knowledge bases.
Finally, we summarize the findings for each block and identify avenues for
further research in this recent and growing body of empirical literature.

"Social interactions for a sustainable lifestyle: The design of an
  experimental case study","  Every day we face numerous lifestyle decisions, some dictated by habits and
some more conscious, which may or may not promote sustainable living. Aided by
digital technology, sustainable behaviors can diffuse within social groups and
inclusive communities. This paper outlines a longitudinal experimental study of
social influence in behavioral changes toward sustainability, in the context of
smart residential homes. Participants are residing in the housing on campus

communities through its transparent and collaborative nature. Given its
critical role in scientific research, ensuring the sustainability of such
software has become vital. Earlier studies have proposed sustainability
strategies for conventional scientific software and open-source communities.
However, it remains unclear whether these solutions can be easily adapted to
the integrated framework of scientific OSS and its larger ecosystem. This study
examines the challenges and opportunities to enhance the sustainability of
scientific OSS in the context of interdisciplinary collaboration, open-source

core contributors regarding their participation in an interdisciplinary team, a
survey of disengaged contributors about their motivations for contribution,
reasons for disengagement, and suggestions for sustaining the communities, and
finally, an analysis of cross-referenced issues and pull requests to understand
best practices for collaboration on the ecosystem level. Our study reveals the

"SOPA: A Framework for Sustainability-Oriented Process Analysis and
  Re-design in Business Process Management","  Given the continuous global degradation of the Earth's ecosystem due to
unsustainable human activity, it is increasingly important for enterprises to
evaluate the effects they have on the environment. Consequently, assessing the
impact of business processes on sustainability is becoming an important
consideration in the discipline of Business Process Management (BPM). However,
existing practical approaches that aim at a sustainability-oriented analysis of
business processes provide only a limited perspective on the environmental
impact caused. Further, they provide no clear and practically applicable
mechanism for sustainability-driven process analysis and re-design. Following a
design science methodology, we here propose and study SOPA, a framework for
sustainability-oriented process analysis and re-design. SOPA extends the BPM
life cycle by use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for sustainability analysis in
combination with Activity-based Costing (ABC). We evaluate SOPA and its
usefulness with a case study, by means of an implementation to support the
approach, thereby also illustrating the practical applicability of this work.

Through energy droughts: hydropower's ability to sustain a high output,"  Previous research has raised concerns about energy droughts in
renewables-based energy systems. This study explores the ability of reservoir
hydropower to sustain a high output and, thereby, mitigate such energy
droughts. Using detailed modelling, we estimate that Swedish hydropower can
sustain 67-92% of its installed capacity for 3 weeks, with higher values
possible in springtime. The variation of the sustained output, equivalent to
the capacity of 3-4 Swedish nuclear reactors, under-scores the importance of
understanding the potential output levels when devising strategies to
counteract energy droughts. Moreover, we find that regulations imposed on the
flows in river bottlenecks hinder higher sustained output levels. With the
upcoming renewal of environmental permits for hydropower plants in Sweden,
these findings provide valuable insights for policymakers. Furthermore, the
sustained output capabilities demonstrated in this study challenge the
prevalent simplified representations of hydropower in energy models, suggesting
a need for more-sophisticated modelling approaches.

"Online Learning of Temporal Dependencies for Sustainable Foraging
  Problem","  The sustainable foraging problem is a dynamic environment testbed for
exploring the forms of agent cognition in dealing with social dilemmas in a
multi-agent setting. The agents need to resist the temptation of individual
rewards through foraging and choose the collective long-term goal of
sustainability. We investigate methods of online learning in Neuro-Evolution
and Deep Recurrent Q-Networks to enable agents to attempt the problem one-shot
as is often required by wicked social problems. We further explore if learning
temporal dependencies with Long Short-Term Memory may be able to aid the agents
in developing sustainable foraging strategies in the long term. It was found
that the integration of Long Short-Term Memory assisted agents in developing

"Sustaining Security and Safety in ICT: A Quest for Terminology,
  Objectives, and Limits","  Security and safety are intertwined concepts in the world of computing. In
recent years, the terms ""sustainable security"" and ""sustainable safety"" came
into fashion and are being used referring to a variety of systems properties
ranging from efficiency to profitability, and sometimes meaning that a product
or service is good for people and planet. This leads to confusing perceptions
of products where customers might expect a sustainable product to be developed
without child labour, while the producer uses the term to signify that their
new product uses marginally less power than the previous generation of that
products. Even in research on sustainably safe and secure ICT, these different
notions of terminology are prevalent. As researchers we often work towards
optimising our subject of study towards one specific sustainability metric -
let's say energy consumption - while being blissfully unaware of, e.g., social
impacts, life-cycle impacts, or rebound effects of such optimisations.
  In this paper I dissect the idea of sustainable safety and security, starting
from the questions of what we want to sustain, and for whom we want to sustain
it. I believe that a general ""people and planet"" answer is inadequate here
because this form of sustainability cannot be the property of a single industry
sector but must be addressed by society as a whole. However, with sufficient
understanding of life-cycle impacts we may very well be able to devise research
and development efforts, and inform decision making processes towards the use
of integrated safety and security solutions that help us to address societal
challenges in the context of the climate and ecological crises, and that are
aligned with concepts such as intersectionality and climate justice. Of course,
these solutions can only be effective if they are embedded in societal and
economic change towards more frugal uses of data and ICT.

"How Early Participation Determines Long-Term Sustained Activity in
  GitHub Projects?","  Although the open source model bears many advantages in software development,
open source projects are always hard to sustain. Previous research on open
source sustainability mainly focuses on projects that have already reached a
certain level of maturity (e.g., with communities, releases, and downstream
projects). However, limited attention is paid to the development of
(sustainable) open source projects in their infancy, and we believe an
understanding of early sustainability determinants is crucial for project
initiators, incubators, newcomers, and users.
  In this paper, we aim to explore the relationship between early participation
factors and long-term project sustainability. We leverage a novel methodology
combining the Blumberg model of performance and machine learning to predict the
sustainability of 290,255 GitHub projects. Specificially, we train an XGBoost
model based on early participation (first three months of activity) in 290,255
GitHub projects and we interpret the model using LIME. We quantitatively show
that early participants have a positive effect on project's future sustained
activity if they have prior experience in OSS project incubation and
demonstrate concentrated focus and steady commitment. Participation from
non-code contributors and detailed contribution documentation also promote
project's sustained activity. Compared with individual projects, building a
community that consists of more experienced core developers and more active
peripheral developers is important for organizational projects. This study
provides unique insights into the incubation and recognition of sustainable
open source projects, and our interpretable prediction approach can also offer
guidance to open source project initiators and newcomers.

"COVID-19 and Digital Transformation -- Developing an Open Experimental
  Testbed for Sustainable and Innovative Environments (ETSIE) using Fuzzy
  Cognitive Maps","  This paper sketches a new approach using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to
operably map and simulate digital transformation in architecture and urban
planning. Today these processes are poorly understood. Many current studies on
digital transformation are only treating questions of economic efficiency.
Sustainability and social impact only play a minor role. Decisive definitions,
concepts and terms stay unclear. Therefore this paper develops an open
experimental testbed for sustainable and innovative environments (ETSIE) for
three different digital transformation scenarios using FCMs. A traditional
growth-oriented scenario, a COVID-19 scenario and an innovative and sustainable
COVID-19 scenario are modeled and tested. All three scenarios have the same
number of components, connections and the same driver components. Only the
initial state vectors are different and the internal correlations are weighted
differently. This allows for comparing all three scenarios on an equal basis.
The mental modeler software is used (Gray et al. 2013). This paper presents one
of the first applications of FCMs in the context of digital transformation. It
is shown, that the traditional growth-oriented scenario is structurally very
similar to the current COVID-19 scenario. The current pandemic is able to
accelerate digital transformation to a certain extent. But the pandemic does
not guarantee for a distinct sustainable and innovative future development.
Only by changing the initial state vectors and the weights of the connections
an innovative and sustainable turnaround in a third scenario becomes possible.

"E-commerce for Rural Micro-Entrepreneurs: Mapping Restrictions,
  Ecologies of Use and Trends for Development","  This paper addresses the struggle of rural micro-entrepreneurs in the Global
South in utilizing e-commerce to reach wider markets. This research paper looks
at the adoption of e-commerce as a sustainable marketplace by the
micro-entrepreneur sellers from the lower socio-economic rural communities in
India, a booming digital economy in the Global South. 'Sustainability' here
refers to a model for sustainable economic development sustaining the
e-commerce as business model for the rural micro-entrepreneurs to flourish.
This paper explores rural development by dismantling the factors that shape the
ways technology and trade impact micro-entrepreneurs. The aim is to offer
recommendations and solutions to contribute building the e-commerce as a
sustainable marketplace for rural micro-entrepreneurs. Recent information and
economic policy changes in India, along with the expansion of mobile
infrastructure and a growing user base in rural regions makes this research
timely and important. By scrutinizing the infrastructure and auditing the
information needs and challenges of users, this research will illuminate the
gaps that are leading to a lack of sustainable economic development, and
information asymmetries discouraging the rural micro-entrepreneurs from selling
online. The purpose of the paper is to find hurdles in the sustainable
development of e-commerce as a business solution.

"Empirical Study of Sustaining the Actualized Value Propositions of
  Implemented E-Government Projects in Sub-Saharan Africa","  Governments in sub-Saharan Africa have implemented e-Government projects.
Actualizing the value propositions and sustaining such values are becoming
problematic. Some scanty studies on the value propositions of implemented
e-Government projects did not consider actualization of the values. Besides,
such studies lack theoretical underpinnings, the identification, and measure of
what constitutes actualized values. Neither did they capture what mechanisms
could sustain the actualized values nor the contextual conditions enabling its
sustainability. Consequently, using a concept-centric systematic review, we
identified the value proposition of such implemented projects. By drawing from
theories of affordance actualization, realist evaluation (RE) theory,
self-determination theory, and sustainability framework for e-Government
success. We conducted a RE of the implemented e-Government projects in Rwanda
using RE as a methodology in three phases. In phase one, we developed the
initial program theory (IPT), in phase two, we used contingent valuation as a
quantitative approach and realist interview as qualitative method to validate
the IPT. Lastly, in the third phase, we synthesized the results of the two
investigative case studies to develop the actualized values sustainability
framework. Such framework encapsulates, the actualized value propositions,
mechanisms and enabling conditions in interactions to sustain the value
propositions discovered in the e-Government investigative contexts.

"Towards Unifying Resilience and Sustainability for Transportation
  Infrastructure Systems: Conceptual Framework, Critical Indicators, and
  Research Needs","  Sustainability aspects of transportation infrastructure systems primarily
focus on system performance based on environmental, social, and economic
impacts. In contrast, resilience aspects demonstrate the ability to withstand
external shocks i.e. robustness as well as to recover from the loss of
functionality due to such disruptions i.e. rapidity. Therefore, sustainability
and resilience are two key aspects which should be given adequate attention
during the planning, design, construction, operations, and maintenance phases
of any civil infrastructure system. As both concepts are equally important to
sustain an infrastructure for a longer duration, their concurrent assessments
within a unified framework are highly desirable. While there has been a recent
focus towards solving this dilemma, review of existing studies revealed the
lack of such unifying frameworks that can quantify sustainability and
resilience indicators to simultaneously assess system performance. Moreover, a
single decision or performance indicator could reinforce one and undermine
another. As such, this study proposed a forward-looking unification framework,
where the sustainability and resilience of transportation infrastructure
systems can be analyzed simultaneously. In this regard, the proposed unifying
framework is explained using seven critical indicators including emission,
speed, temperature, energy consumption, delay, mobility, and accessibility.
This study also investigates the interdependencies, relationships, and
tradeoffs between sustainability and resilience based on these indices. While
some indices would help the system to attain both at the same time, they are
compromised in some cases. Finally, the study identifies immediate research
needs as well as the ones in the long-term.

"Social Sustainability of Digital Transformation: Empirical Evidence from
  EU-27 Countries","  In the EU-27 countries, the importance of social sustainability of digital
transformation (SOSDIT) is heightened by the need to balance economic growth
with social cohesion. By prioritizing SOSDIT, the EU can ensure that its
citizens are not left behind in the digital transformation process and that
technology serves the needs of all Europeans. Therefore, the current study
aimed firstly to evaluate the SOSDIT of EU-27 countries and then to model its
importance in reaching sustainable development goals (SDGs). The current study,
using structural equation modeling, provided quantitative empirical evidence
that digital transformation in Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are
respectively most socially sustainable. It is also found that SOSDIT leads the
countries to have a higher performance in reaching SDGs. Finally, the study
provided evidence implying the inverse relationship between the Gini
coefficient and reaching SDGs. In other words, the higher the Gini coefficient
of a country, the lower its performance in reaching SDGs. The findings of this
study contribute to the literature of sustainability and digitalization. It
also provides empirical evidence regarding the SOSDIT level of EU-27 countries
that can be a foundation for the development of policies to improve the
sustainability of digital transformation. According to the findings, this study
provides practical recommendations for countries to ensure that their digital
transformation is sustainable and has a positive impact on society.

"Sustainable development-oriented campus bike-sharing site evaluation
  model: A case study of Henan Polytechnic University","  Promoting sustainable transportation options is increasingly crucial in the
pursuit of environmentally friendly and efficient campus mobility systems.
Among these options, bike-sharing programs have garnered substantial attention
for their capacity to mitigate traffic congestion, decrease carbon emissions,
and enhance overall campus sustainability. However, improper selection of
bike-sharing sites has led to the growing problems of unsustainable practices
in campus, including the disorderly parking and indiscriminate placement of
bike-sharing. To this end, this paper proposes a novel sustainable
development-oriented campus bike-sharing site evaluation model integrating the
improved Delphi and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation approaches. Fourteen
evaluation metrics are firstly selected from four dimensions: the user
features, implementation and usage characteristics of parking spots,
environmental sustainability, and social sustainability, through the
combination of expert experience and the improved Delphi method. Then, the
analytic hierarchy process and the entropy weight method are employed to
determine the weights of the evaluation indices, ensuring a robust and
objective assessment framework. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method is
finally implemented to evaluate the quality of location selection. South Campus
of Henan Polytechnic University is selected as a case study using the proposed
evaluation system. This work contributes to the existing body of knowledge by
presenting a comprehensive location selection evaluation system for campus
bike-sharing, informed by the principles of sustainable development.

Architecture Knowledge Representation and Communication Industry Survey,"  Background: The literature offers various methods for capturing software
architectural knowledge (AK), including views, viewpoints, and architecture
decision records (ADRs). In parallel, sustainability has gained prominence in
software engineering, especially concerning software architecture.
Nevertheless, practical industry reviews on these subjects seem to be lacking.
Aim: In this research we aim to understand the current practice in architecture
knowledge, and to explore where sustainability can be applied to address
sustainability in software architecture in the future. Method: We used a
survey, which utilized a questionnaire containing 34 questions and collected
responses from 45 architects working at a prominent bank in the Netherlands,
aimed to evaluate the practical representation and communication of
architectural knowledge and sustainability. Result: Our analysis yielded two
primary discoveries and several intriguing detailed results regarding how AK is
captured and conveyed to diverse stakeholders. Firstly, it seems crucial to
develop a new architectural element that connects various architectural
features and perspectives tailored for different stakeholders. Secondly,
providing clear guidance, references, and goals is essential to motivate
architects to adopt Sustainable Software Engineering practices. Conclusion:
After analysing the data collected through this survey, we have concluded that:
a) There are no established domain-specific AK methods/tools in the financial
domain. Most practitioners use domain-generic tools. b) A new architectural
element that links the various architectural features and viewpoints created
for various stakeholders appears to be necessary. c) There is sufficient
sustainability awareness and motivation among software architects. However,
what they lack are clear guidance, references, and goals to practice
sustainable software engineering.
